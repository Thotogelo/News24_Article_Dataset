"","While the digital age presents vast opportunities, it also demands vigilance. By keeping these tips in mind, you can navigate the online job market confidently, avoiding pitfalls and potential scams.

In the age of rapid digitisation, job hunting has never been more accessible. With just a few clicks, you can apply to numerous jobs from the comfort of your home. Yet, the convenience has also opened doors to opportunistic scammers who prey on eager job seekers. It's essential to be savvy and discerning. Here's how you can spot a scam job ad and keep yourself safe.

1. Too Good To Be True? It Probably Is.

A hallmark of many scam ads is the promise of an unusually high salary for minimal effort or experience. While we all dream of such opportunities, it's essential to remain grounded and sceptical.

2. Vague Job Descriptions

Legitimate companies are clear about what they're looking for. If you come across a job ad that's ambiguous or overly generic, tread carefully.

3. Unprofessional Email Addresses

Be wary of job offers or communications coming from free email services like Gmail, Yahoo, or Hotmail. Genuine businesses often have domain-specific emails.

4. Immediate Job Offers

It's a red flag if you're offered a job without an interview or a vetting process. This isn't a testament to your skills but is more likely a scam.

5. Requests for Personal Information

If a job ad or employer asks for personal information like your Identity Number, bank details, or any other sensitive data upfront, it's almost certainly a scam.

6. Payment or Investment Required

Be cautious of job offers that ask you to purchase starter kits or invest in the company before you even begin. A legitimate employer will never demand money from its employees.

7. Check Their Digital Footprint

An easy way to verify a company's legitimacy is to check its online presence. Do they have an official website? Are they active on social media? A lack of a digital footprint can be a significant indicator.

8. Poor Grammar and Spelling

Professional organisations take pride in their communication. Job ads riddled with grammatical mistakes or awkward phrasing should raise suspicions.

9. Research Company Reviews

Sites like Glassdoor or Indeed can provide insights into a company’s reputation. However, remember that reviews can be manipulated. Trust patterns more than isolated comments.

10. Trust Your Gut

Lastly, listen to your intuition. If something feels off or too rushed, it probably is.

<p>While the digital age presents vast opportunities, it also demands vigilance. By keeping these tips in mind, you can navigate the online job market confidently, avoiding pitfalls and potential scams.</p>

<p>In the age of rapid digitisation, job hunting has never been more accessible. With just a few clicks, you can apply to numerous jobs from the comfort of your home. Yet, the convenience has also opened doors to opportunistic scammers who prey on eager job seekers. It's essential to be savvy and discerning. Here's how you can spot a scam job ad and keep yourself safe.</p>

<p><strong>1. Too Good To Be True? It Probably Is.</strong></p>

<p>A hallmark of many scam ads is the promise of an unusually high salary for minimal effort or experience. While we all dream of such opportunities, it's essential to remain grounded and sceptical.</p>

<p><strong>2. Vague Job Descriptions</strong></p>

<p>Legitimate companies are clear about what they're looking for. If you come across a job ad that's ambiguous or overly generic, tread carefully.</p>

<p><strong>3. Unprofessional Email Addresses</strong></p>

<p>Be wary of job offers or communications coming from free email services like Gmail, Yahoo, or Hotmail. Genuine businesses often have domain-specific emails.</p>

<p><strong>4. Immediate Job Offers</strong></p>

<p>It's a red flag if you're offered a job without an interview or a vetting process. This isn't a testament to your skills but is more likely a scam.</p>

<p><strong>5. Requests for Personal Information</strong></p>

<p>If a job ad or employer asks for personal information like your Identity Number, bank details, or any other sensitive data upfront, it's almost certainly a scam.</p>

<p><strong>6. Payment or Investment Required</strong></p>

<p>Be cautious of job offers that ask you to purchase starter kits or invest in the company before you even begin. A legitimate employer will never demand money from its employees.</p>

<p><strong>7. Check Their Digital Footprint</strong></p>

<p>An easy way to verify a company's legitimacy is to check its online presence. Do they have an official website? Are they active on social media? A lack of a digital footprint can be a significant indicator.</p>

<p><strong>8. Poor Grammar and Spelling</strong></p>

<p>Professional organisations take pride in their communication. Job ads riddled with grammatical mistakes or awkward phrasing should raise suspicions.</p>

<p><strong>9. Research Company Reviews</strong></p>

<p>Sites like Glassdoor or Indeed can provide insights into a company’s reputation. However, remember that reviews can be manipulated. Trust patterns more than isolated comments.</p>

<p><strong>10. Trust Your Gut</strong></p>

<p>Lastly, listen to your intuition. If something feels off or too rushed, it probably is.</p>

<p>While the digital age presents vast opportunities, it also demands vigilance. By keeping these tips in mind, you can navigate the online job market confidently, avoiding pitfalls and potential scams. Stay informed, stay skeptical, and prioritise your safety.</p>

"","1. The Upswing of Blue-Collar Work

Blue-collar jobs, which typically involve manual labour in trades such as construction, manufacturing, or maintenance, have historically been undervalued compared to white-collar jobs. However, the perception is shifting, especially as the economy witnesses a growing demand for skilled workers in these sectors. South Africa, with its ongoing infrastructure projects and a burgeoning manufacturing sector, presents numerous opportunities for blue-collar workers.

2. Earning Potential and Expected Salaries

The earning potential for blue-collar workers in South Africa can be quite surprising, particularly for those with specialised skills and years of experience. Let's explore some of these professions:

Electricians

A licensed electrician in South Africa can earn between R250,000 to R450,000 annually. Those who own their businesses or work as independent contractors can potentially earn even more. With a constant need for electrical maintenance, repairs, and installations in residential, commercial, and industrial settings, electricians' skills are always in demand.

Plumbers

Plumbers are another group of professionals whose skills are consistently required. They can earn an average salary of R200,000 to R400,000 annually. Plumbers with a specialisation, such as gas fitting or pipe laying, can command higher salaries. Like electricians, plumbers who own their own businesses or work independently can increase their earnings significantly.

Welders

Welding is a critical skill in many sectors, including construction, manufacturing, and shipbuilding. A skilled welder in South Africa can expect to earn between R150,000 and R350,000 per year. Highly experienced welders or those with specialist welding skills can earn even more.

Construction Managers

Construction is a booming industry in South Africa, and experienced construction managers are highly sought after. A construction manager can earn anywhere from R300,000 to R700,000 per year, depending on the complexity of the projects they oversee.

3. The Future of Blue-Collar Work in South Africa

The future of blue-collar work in South Africa looks promising. With the country's ongoing development and a move towards industrialisation, skilled blue-collar workers will continue to be in high demand.

Moreover, the South African government's commitment to infrastructure development and vocational training is likely to further boost opportunities in blue-collar sectors. Various initiatives aim to provide young South Africans with vocational training to fill these roles, ensuring a steady supply of skilled workers for these high-paying blue-collar jobs.

The surprising earning potential of blue-collar work in South Africa is a testament to the changing dynamics of the job market. The perception that only white-collar jobs offer attractive salaries is being challenged. Blue-collar professions, requiring skill, dedication, and often a good deal of physical labour, are offering competitive salaries and attractive career opportunities. This shift not only provides an avenue for financial stability for a wider range of workers but also helps to foster a more diverse and resilient economy.","<article>

Connie Chiume: 45 years in showbiz and still going strong

“During those days, you wouldn’t dare say you wanted to be a singer, musician or actor.”
Connie Chiume

In 1976, she was a teacher earning R101 a month. For her relatives and close friends, this was a job she could not afford to gamble with, let alone lose.

But when Connie Chiume saw an advert in a local newspaper, calling for musicians, singers and actors to come in for auditions, she could not let the opportunity pass her by.

With just 25c in her pocket, the English, mathematics and Sesotho teacher made her way from Orlando in Soweto to Pritchard Street in Johannesburg, where she reconnected with her inner child and put on a performance that would set the stage for more than 40 years in the entertainment industry, a move that, to this day, she “does not regret”.

“I had been presented with an opportunity to travel abroad. I was going to be on a plane and, on top of that, I was going to earn R100 per week.

“I was not going to say no to that. I said: ‘I am going.’ And I did.”

After just a year, Chiume was thrust into the spotlight with her first acting role in the musical Sola Sola, with which she travelled abroad to countries such as Greece and Israel.

The septuagenarian who celebrated her 70th birthday on June 5 recalled:

""I had never been in showbiz, let alone received any sort of acting training. I went to the audition and was told that I was shortlisted. After hearing those words, I went straight to the casting director and asked him what that meant. I was a teacher at the time and I revealed that to him. I asked him to tell me right there and then what it meant, and, just like that, I was cast.""

"","Embrace the possibility of change and the potential it holds for new adventures and achievements. Your next career opportunity might just be around the corner!

Navigating the professional landscape can be challenging, and knowing when it’s time to leave your current job is a crucial skill for career growth and personal satisfaction. If you’re feeling restless or unfulfilled, it might be a sign that your current role no longer aligns with your goals or values. Here’s how to recognise the tell-tale signs that it’s time to make your next career move.

1. You Dread Going to Work

If the thought of going to work fills you with anxiety or dread, it’s a clear signal that something isn’t right. While everyone has off days, consistent feelings of unhappiness or stress are red flags. This emotional drain can significantly impact your overall well-being and productivity.

Action Step: Reflect on what specifically causes these feelings. Is it the workload, the company culture, or a lack of passion for the job itself? Understanding the root cause can help you decide your next steps.

2. Lack of Growth Opportunities

In a fulfilling career, there should always be room for growth and development. If you find that there are no opportunities for advancement or learning new skills, you might feel stuck and uninspired.

Action Step: Have a conversation with your manager about your career aspirations. If there’s no clear path for growth, it might be time to explore new opportunities where your skills and ambitions are valued.

3. Your Values No Longer Align

As you progress in your career, your personal values and goals may evolve. If you find that your company’s mission, culture, or ethical practices no longer align with your own, it can lead to a sense of disconnection and dissatisfaction.

Action Step: Re-evaluate your personal and professional values. Seek out companies that align more closely with your beliefs and where you can feel more integrated and purposeful.

4. You’re Underappreciated or Overworked

Feeling undervalued, consistently overworked, or underpaid are common reasons people decide to move on. When your efforts are not recognised or rewarded, it can lead to burnout and resentment.

Action Step: Assess your current workload and compensation. Have an open discussion with your manager about your concerns and seek recognition or rewards that match your contributions. If the response is unsatisfactory, consider looking for a more appreciative work environment.

5. Toxic Work Environment

A toxic work environment can have a detrimental effect on your mental and physical health. Signs include poor communication, constant negativity, lack of support, and workplace bullying.

Action Step: Document specific instances of toxic behaviour and consider speaking with HR or a trusted advisor within the company. If the environment does not improve, prioritising your health and well-being by seeking a healthier workplace is crucial.

6. You’re No Longer Learning

If you’re not learning anything new and your daily tasks feel monotonous, it could indicate that you’ve outgrown your current role. Continuous learning and challenges are essential for professional satisfaction and growth.

Action Step: Identify areas where you’d like to grow and seek out new projects or responsibilities within your current role. If opportunities are limited, it may be time to find a position that offers more growth potential.

7. Your Gut Tells You It’s Time

Sometimes, your intuition is the best guide. If you have a persistent feeling that it’s time to move on, it’s worth listening to that inner voice.

Action Step: Trust your instincts and start exploring new opportunities. Networking, updating your resume, and researching companies can provide new perspectives and options for your career.

Deciding to leave a job is never easy, but recognising these signs can help you make a more informed and confident decision. Prioritise your happiness, growth, and well-being by seeking opportunities that align with your evolving career goals and personal values. Remember, the right move can lead to a more fulfilling and prosperous career path.

<p>Embrace the possibility of change and the potential it holds for new adventures and achievements. Your next career opportunity might just be around the corner!</p>

<p>Navigating
the professional landscape can be challenging, and knowing when it’s time to
leave your current job is a crucial skill for career growth and personal
satisfaction. If you’re feeling restless or unfulfilled, it might be a sign
that your current role no longer aligns with your goals or values. Here’s how
to recognise the tell-tale signs that it’s time to make your next career move.</p>

<p><strong>1.
You Dread Going to Work</strong></p>

<p>If the
thought of going to work fills you with anxiety or dread, it’s a clear signal
that something isn’t right. While everyone has off days, consistent feelings of
unhappiness or stress are red flags. This emotional drain can significantly
impact your overall well-being and productivity.</p>

<p><strong>Action
Step:</strong> Reflect
on what specifically causes these feelings. Is it the workload, the company
culture, or a lack of passion for the job itself? Understanding the root cause

NOW STREAMING - Silenced: The documentary

Babita Deokaran was a corruption whistle-blower within the Gauteng Department of Health, who was assassinated in a hit-style killing outside her south Johannesburg home in August 2021.

In her role as chief director: financial accounting, Deokaran had been a bulwark against irregular and dubious payments. Owing to her position, she was also in control of the evidentiary paper trail left by those who preyed on public funds, making her an invaluable asset to the Special Investigating Unit.

A News24 investigation which spanned more than a year – examining in excess of 60 000 e-mails and the contents of her cellphone – can reveal the vivid detail of what was her final graft investigation.

In this series, titled Silenced, we reveal what she found in the days before her murder.

'Our lives could be in danger: Inside Babita Deokaran's R850m 'fraud' probe

Babita Deokaran tried to stop R100 million in dodgy payments and flagged nearly R850 million in other suspicious transactions at the Gauteng Department of Health just days before she was killed - confiding in colleagues that her last investigation could result in her death.

""...I am just worried that the guys in Tembisa are going to realise we are not releasing their payments and know that we on to something. Our lives could be in danger,"" Deokaran said in a WhatsApp message to her boss.

Deokaran - a senior manager at the Gauteng health department - was ambushed by hitmen outside her home in Winchester Hills, south Johannesburg. She was shot nine times while pulling into her driveway after dropping off her daughter at school and later died in hospital. Her murder put an end to a decade of cooperation with the Special Investigating Unit and the Hawks as a critical witness within her department.

Nearly a year after she was murdered - drawing from a trove of more than 60 000 emails and the contents of her cellphone - News24 can reveal details of her final graft probe.

Babita Deokaran tried to stop ‘secret’ Tembisa Hospital payments to ANC leader

Three little-known companies headed by Gauteng ANC heavyweight Sello Sekhokho scored contracts providing medical supplies and equipment to Tembisa Hospital worth R2.3 million - his windfall flagged as ""potentially fraudulent"" by Department of Health chief accountant Babita Deokaran just three weeks before she was murdered.

One firm - Kaizen Projects - is among a network of 217 entities Deokaran identified as part of a flood of transactions out of Tembisa Hospital, her suspicion piqued by a buying spree which shot expenditure in July of 2021 sharply up. In a single month, goods and services for the tertiary hospital accounted for R239 million, 25% more than Charlotte Maxeke Academic Hospital, which is four times its size.

The whistleblower reported the splurge to department CFO Lerato Madyo and called for an immediate investigation and a stop on payments worth R104 million. Ten months after she was gunned down in a hit-style killing outside her south Johannesburg home, the payments out of the hospital have yet to be probed in their entirety.

No investigation, no protection: Inside department head's big lie to Babita Deokaran

Gauteng Health boss Lerato Madyo lied when she told Babita Deokaran that her discovery of R850m in dubious Tembisa Hospital payments had been bumped up the chain of command.

News24 can reveal that it was only on the day of Deokaran's assassination that Madyo mentioned to her superiors, in passing, that the whistleblower was worried her life was in danger after moving to halt payments to a politically connected businessman and hundreds of other companies.

Beyond this, the report in which Deokaran called for an urgent probe into the hospital's spending patterns was never formally escalated. Madyo received it three weeks before the murder.

Tembisa Hospital contract factory: R500k on leather loungers and letterbox barons unmasked

Tembisa Hospital bosses splurged R500 000 on 100 leather wingback chairs – this deal just one of a surge of dubious payments flagged by Babita Deokaran before she was assassinated.
A News24 investigation, drawing from key documents contained in thousands of Deokaran’s emails, can reveal that the East Rand hospital was turned into a contract factory. In four months, it processed more than 1 200 purchase orders worth more than R600 million.
While struggling with overcrowding, staff shortages and a dearth of funding, the hospital channelled nearly R60 million in payments to letterbox companies that exist only on paper. Twenty entities which simultaneously billed the hospital are controlled by four people. Each registered five companies on the same day and provided fake addresses when doing so.

Love me tender: How husband and wife bagged R30m in Tembisa Hospital contracts

A part-time call centre agent and her sound engineer husband landed Tembisa Hospital contracts worth nearly R30 million in the space of a month - part of a mammoth extraction network uncovered by murdered whistleblower Babita Deokaran.

Christine and Avikash Signarian each control five companies that saw a flurry of trade from the hospital, contracted to provide everything from ventilators to ICU beds.

Seventy payments to entities they own are among more than a thousand ""possibly fraudulent"" transactions flagged by Deokaran three weeks before she was assassinated. Her call for a forensic probe into the hospital’s buying patterns were ignored and payments worth R850 million are yet to be fully examined.

Under fire Tembisa hospital boss calls on ANC connections over News24 investigation

The Tembisa Hospital CEO, responsible for approving millions of rand in dodgy payments flagged by Babita Deokaran, has roped in his ANC connections because ""he is struggling with News24"".

This publication was contacted by a member of the ANC’s communications team on Tuesday to set up a meeting with hospital boss Ashley Mthunzi, after Mthunzi asked the convenor of the ANC’s Progressive Business Forum to intercede on his behalf.

The overtures by ANC operatives came despite various requests for comment to Mthunzi on what Deokaran found at Tembisa Hospital. These requests have however gone unanswered.

Tembisa Hospital’s R500 000 skinny jean spending spree... and the soccer star who scored

Tembisa Hospital bosses splurged R500 000 on a shipment of skinny jeans – purchased while South Africa was in the grip of the Covid-19 pandemic and just weeks before a third wave strained medical facilities to breaking point.

The payment for 200 pairs of denims - for girls aged between 6 and 7 – was flagged by Babita Deokaran alongside thousands of other transactions out of the East Rand hospital worth more than R850 million. She was assassinated three weeks later.

The jeans contract was awarded to an obscure company named Inez Chaste - one of 10 separate business entities controlled by retired soccer star Themba Shabalala and his wife Evelyn.

'We've heard nothing' from cops - Babita Deokaran's family as SIU investigation moves forward

The family of murdered whistleblower Babita Deokaran has heard ""nothing"" from the police or investigating officer about the status of the investigation into the mastermind of her assassination.

""We have heard nothing from them… not once have they called us. The last time we were contacted by the investigating team was right after the incident,"" Deokaran's brother, Rakesh, said.

Tembisa Hospital splurge exposed: leather loungers, skinny jeans, and R10 000 for a bucket

Four members of the Mazibuko clan control 17 separate entities that were flagged by whistleblower Babita Deokaran – three weeks before her murder – in a report that raised alarm over R850 million in ""possibly fraudulent"" payments out of the hospital.

A News24 investigation based on a trove of Gauteng health department e-mails can reveal that the family established a dynasty providing medical equipment and supplies to several health facilities in the province. But it was the Tembisa Hospital supply chain management office that delivered their heyday.

On 8 February 2021, two payments of R19 600 were processed for ""bucket heavy duty 12.5l plastic (sic)"". The hospital bought two in red and two in blue, and paid nearly 5 000% of the price it should have paid.

'Don of Tembisa' received millions in payments, bought Bantry Bay and Sandton mansions

Babita Deokaran red-flagged R36 million in Tembisa Hospital payments bound for companies linked to Hangwani Morgan Maumela, a high-flying tender tycoon whose property portfolio stretches from Bantry Bay to Sandton.

Twelve firms in his family network are among hundreds behind a dubious R850-million hospital buying spree that Deokaran reported to Gauteng health department bosses. She raised fears that stopping payments could place her life in danger. She was assassinated three weeks later.

Impeccable sources inside the health department described Maumela as ""the don"" of Tembisa Hospital, who held sway with management and had direct access to its procurement office.

Inside the 'confidential' Tembisa Hospital audit which was buried after Deokaran hit

A Gauteng health department audit of Tembisa Hospital launched after Babita Deokaran red-flagged R850 million in dodgy payments was buried for more than a year - and recommendations for an urgent investigation were abandoned.

Internal auditors found that hospital officials corrupted the procurement system and tampered with documents in order to channel contracts worth millions to companies which had been hand-picked to score big.

According to the confidential report filed in September last year, obtained by News24, auditors tested a random sample of just 18 individual payments – of 1 203 identified by Deokaran before her murder – and found that all were irregular.

The Tembisa tender 'don' and his cosy ties to Ramaphosa and key advisor

President Cyril Ramaphosa’s nephew by marriage – tender ""don"" Hangwani Morgan Maumela – is a central figure in the R850-million Tembisa Hospital procurement scandal first reported by Babita Deokaran before she was assassinated.

Through a web of companies, Maumela and his cousin scored R36 million in trade from the East Rand hospital in a period spanning only weeks – the transactions among more than a thousand now under investigation by Special Investigating Unit (SIU).

News24 can also reveal that the businessman’s links to the Union Buildings run deeper, with ties to Ramaphosa’s right-hand - principal political advisor Bejani Chauke. The pair are essentially neighbours in a plush Hyde Park security complex within walking distance of Ramaphosa’s private residence.

Camps Bay to Zimbali: Inside Tembisa tender don’s R280m property bonanza

A family trust controlled by Tembisa tender ""don"" Hangwani Morgan Maumela snapped up palatial homes across the country – amassing a R280-million property portfolio, that spans from Zimbali to Camps Bay, in the space of five years, News24 can reveal.

Maumela and a relative, through a network of twelve companies, banked R380 million in contracts for the supply of everything from décor to medical gear from the Gauteng health department since 2019.

Ten percent of these payments were red flagged by Babita Deokaran in a report into ""possibly fraudulent"" transactions out of Tembisa Hospital three weeks before she was murdered.

The 39-year-old businessman has ties that stretch to the Union Buildings - as a distant relative by marriage to President Cyril Ramaphosa, and neighbour and associate to his principal political advisor, Bejani Chauke.

How Tembisa Hospital’s R500k skinny jean supplier and shell corporation bosses flew the coop

The company behind the R500 000 Tembisa Hospital skinny jeans scandal has a new owner – a man who overnight become the controlling hand of 54 entities red-flagged by Babita Deokaran before her assassination.

Dr Stefan Joel Govindraju now directs the group of companies which saw R116 million in dubious trade from the hospital, his conglomerate accounting for nearly a quarter of the 217 ""possibly fraudulent"" entities unearthed by the whistleblower.

In two days, company directors resigned en masse, and ceded control to him. The companies – shell corporations that used false addresses and exist only on paper - form part of an extraction network that scored hundreds of contracts from the East Rand health facility, providing everything from luxury leather furniture to ventilators.

Mother of Tembisa tender ‘don’ scores R30m Sea Point property as tenderpreneur network expands

Mboneni Maumela – a retiree and elderly mother of Tembisa Hospital tender tycoon Hangwani Morgan Maumela – splurged R30 million on two Sea Point flats, pushing up the value of the family’s property portfolio north of R310 million.

On the same day in March this year, the 66-year-old became the owner of units 49 and 133 in the luxury Twin Towers block, with views of the Atlantic seaboard and flanked by the Sea Point promenade. Each unit cost R14.5 million, according to deeds office records.

While the source of her wealth remains unknown, the former civil servant appears to be backed by her son who, along with his cousin Aluwani Maumela, raked in R381 million in contracts from Gauteng state hospitals in three years, with 93% of their heyday coming from Tembisa.

Babita Deokaran flagged network of lovers, friends and co-workers 'fleecing' public purse

New Tembisa Hospital tender don Stefan Govindraju – who took control of an empire of companies which scored R116 million in deals red-flagged by Babita Deokaran – has longstanding links to an extraction network that saw bank tellers, call-centre agents and sound technicians become overnight millionaires.

After News24 exposed the hospital tender mafia, company directors inexplicably resigned en masse and ceded control to Govindraju. His takeover played out in less than 48 hours.

News24 can now reveal Govindraju’s connection to the companies - behind a flood of unregulated medical equipment sold to the hospital - as the final link in a chain of lovers, relatives, friends, and co-workers.

SIU unravels R1 billion Tembisa tender syndicates

The Special Investigating Unit (SIU) recommended Tembisa Hospital tender kingpins Hangwani Maumela and Stefan Govindraju – whose companies landed contracts worth R775 million in less than two years - face prosecution for fraud.

A preliminary SIU report released on Tuesday found that networks of shell corporations banked more than R1 billion in dubious payments from the impoverished hospital. These syndicates and those behind them were first exposed by News24 in a series titled Silenced.

Investigators uncovered evidence that Maumela and Govindraju, through companies they controlled, in some cases, provided fake documents to the Gauteng Department of Health which paved the way for a flood of payments.

Tembisa Hospital's R500 000 chicken tender, and how the inside men feathered the nest

Tembisa Hospital splurged R500 000 on six tons of frozen chicken in a deal tainted by irregularities, false documents and price inflation. This payment is one of hundreds now in the crosshairs of the Special Investigating Unit.

The graft-busting squad found that hospital officials flouted buying processes, a key enabler for a tender mafia first identified by Babita Deokaran three weeks before she was assassinated.

Those officials who swung dicey contracts are still at work, and some are still in charge of procurement.

The contract was awarded to an unknown company named Fairg Holdings, which operates from a rundown house in suburban Benoni on the East Rand.

SIU investigators concluded that falsified and altered documents were overlooked in order to close the deal - with a price nearly double what it should have been.

Tembisa tender tycoon, his 'mama cat', and their brazen blue-light brigade

Tembisa Hospital tender tycoon Vusimuzi Matlala – whose companies scored nearly R5 million in contracts red-flagged by Babita Deokaran – is now under investigation for his illegal blue-light cavalcade used for airport trips and school runs.

Matlala’s partner Cordelia Kabeng, calling herself ""mama cat"", boasted to her 12 000 Instagram followers about her high-speed escorts, replete with lights and sirens, to drop off her ""cubs"".

Matlala has close ties to Hangwani Morgan Maumela, the central node in an extraction syndicate of little-known companies and opaque trusts which saw R23 million in dicey payments channelled their way.

Tembisa tender mafia: Syndicates expand, and look to other hospital feeding troughs

Front company kingpin Stefan Govindraju - who controls a tender extraction network which bled R440 million from Tembisa Hospital - has been linked to more shady state suppliers, with worrying signals that the contract feeding frenzy stretches into other hospitals.

Five of his companies, outside of 217 ""possibly fraudulent"" entities red-flagged by Babita Deokaran before her assassination, are now under investigation by the Gauteng Department of Health after irregularities were discovered in the way they operate.

'Are u ok?' Crucial Tembisa Hospital corruption evidence stolen

Suspended Gauteng health department boss Lerato Madyo’s cellphone – a critical piece of evidence in a R850-million fraud and corruption probe into Tembisa Hospital – was stolen before cops could analyse it.

The phone – with its record of a WhatsApp chat between Madyo and whistleblower Babita Deokaran – was reported stolen in March last year.

In the weeks before she was murdered, Deokaran briefed Madyo about her concerns over Tembisa Hospital spending, fears that her life was in danger, and misgivings surrounding lucrative contracts scored by an ANC politician, according to a history of near-daily conversations, obtained by News24.

'They took my phone': Hawks raid ANC bigwig in R1bn Tembisa corruption scandal

Flashy ANC boss Sello Sekhokho and his fleet of companies - that scored nearly R100 million in shady contracts from Gauteng hospitals in just three years – are in the crosshairs of a R1-billion Tembisa Hospital fraud and corruption probe.

Early on Wednesday morning, Hawks detectives swooped on Sekhokho's home and two properties from which he runs his business empire, seizing documents, computers and cellphones.

A company named Kaizen Projects – controlled by the 37-year-old politician – was among the first of 217 entities redflagged by whistleblower Babita Deokaran, after she noticed a surge in spending out of Tembisa Hospital. Three weeks after she reported concerns over the legitimacy of the company and others, she was assassinated outside her home.

R250m Tembisa Hospital extraction syndicate is still scoring tenders

A company that forms part of the extraction syndicate which banked R250 million in shady Tembisa Hospital contracts, was paid nearly R1 million by the Gauteng Department of Health – after it was red-flagged by the Special Investigating Unit.

The little-known company called Minzorex scored two contracts from Edenvale Hospital and was paid R985 100 in two transactions – the last lump sum landing in the firm's bank account in January.

The big score: Tembisa tender kings 'inflated' prices for embattled hospital by up to 2 000%

Gauteng Department of Health boss Lerato Madyo and Tembisa Hospital CEO Ashley Mthunzi signed off on medical supply contracts with grossly inflated prices, overlooking a litany of discrepancies, including forged documents.

In one instance, the price of surgical drapes was gouged by nearly 2 000%.

Last month, the pair were each charged with misconduct during internal disciplinary action arising from 13 transactions they approved, among more than a thousand dubious payments flagged by provincial financial manager Babita Deokaran before her murder. They both now face dismissal if found guilty.

Now nearly 900 pages of documentary evidence, which underpins misconduct allegations, have been filed in the disciplinary inquiry. This trove of bid documents, quotes and purchase orders reveal how easily supply chain management prescripts were flouted and bypassed, and how prices soared.

'Fraud', 'forgery' and Tembisa tender kingpin's 300% markup: This is how he did it

Three companies with secret ties to front company kingpin Stefan Govindraju bid against one another for a lucrative Tembisa Hospital deal - the tainted contract now linked to a R440-million tender extraction syndicate.

This deal saw Tembisa Hospital pay 300% more than they should have for sutures, News24 can reveal.

In another, a company linked to Govindraju submitted forged documents which allowed them to win a supply contract for ventilator parts worth R496 000. These dubious transactions are among thousands of payments flagged by Babita Deokaran just weeks before she was assassinated outside her home.

'I know nothing': How a pool cleaner, unemployed guard were used to 'cook' Tembisa tenders

Two Limpopo women, one a municipal worker and the other an unemployed security guard, became unwitting bedfellows when their ""stolen"" identities were used in a scheme to rig a lucrative Tembisa Hospital contract, News24 can reveal.

Raesibe Motebejano spends her days cleaning the Polokwane Municipality's public swimming pools. The 44-year-old's signature also appears on bid documents for an entity called Black AK Trading and Suppliers, which tendered for a supplier contract from the East Rand Hospital.

Tembisa tender 'don's' luxury properties flash sale and the realtors who kept it 'secret'

Tembisa Hospital tender ""don"" Hangwani Morgan Maumela is selling off chunks of his R280 million property portfolio in a hurry – and a boutique real estate agency has seemingly helped him avoid the prying eyes of the Special Investigating Unit.

Maumela – President Cyril Ramaphosa's nephew from a previous marriage – was named by the SIU as a central figure in a R1 billion extraction scheme at the healthcare facility. A network of companies tied to Maumela and hundreds of payments from Tembisa Hospital were first discovered by Babita Deokaran before she was assassinated in August 2021.

News24 can reveal that in one property deal, the R14 million sale of a Hurlingham mansion in April, Live Real Estate and agents Brendan Miller and Jacqui Steinmann allegedly knew that Maumela was under investigation by the SIU – and pushed the sale in secret.

<p>Babita Deokaran was a corruption whistle-blower within the Gauteng Department of Health, who was assassinated in a hit-style killing outside her south Johannesburg home in August 2021.</p>

<p>In her role as chief director: financial accounting, Deokaran had been a bulwark against irregular and dubious payments. Owing to her position, she was also in control of the evidentiary paper trail left by those who preyed on public funds, making her an invaluable asset to the Special Investigating Unit.</p>

<p>A News24 investigation which spanned more than a year – examining in excess of 60 000 e-mails and the contents of her cellphone – can reveal the vivid detail of what was her final graft investigation.</p>

<p>In this series, titled <em>Silenced, </em>we reveal what she found in the days before her murder.</p>

<h3><strong>'Our lives could be in danger: Inside Babita Deokaran's R850m 'fraud' probe</strong></h3>

<p>Babita Deokaran tried to stop R100 million in dodgy payments and flagged nearly R850 million in other suspicious transactions at the Gauteng Department of Health just days before she was killed - confiding in colleagues that her last investigation could result in her death.</p>

<p>""...I am just worried that the guys in Tembisa are going to realise we are not releasing their payments and know that we on to something. Our lives could be in danger,"" Deokaran said in a WhatsApp message to her boss.</p>

<p>Deokaran - a senior manager at the Gauteng health department - was ambushed by hitmen outside her home in Winchester Hills, south Johannesburg. She was shot nine times while pulling into her driveway after dropping off her daughter at school and later died in hospital. Her murder put an end to a decade of cooperation with the Special Investigating Unit and the Hawks as a critical witness within her department.</p>

<p>Nearly a year after she was murdered - drawing from a trove of more than 60 000 emails and the contents of her cellphone - News24 can reveal details of her final graft probe.</p>

<h3>Babita Deokaran tried to stop ‘secret’ Tembisa Hospital payments to ANC leader</h3>

<p>Three little-known companies headed by Gauteng ANC heavyweight Sello Sekhokho scored contracts providing medical supplies and equipment to Tembisa Hospital worth R2.3 million - his windfall flagged as ""potentially fraudulent"" by Department of Health chief accountant Babita Deokaran just three weeks before she was murdered.</p>

<p>One firm - Kaizen Projects - is among a network of 217 entities Deokaran identified as part of a flood of transactions out of Tembisa Hospital, her suspicion piqued by a buying spree which shot expenditure in July of 2021 sharply up. In a single month, goods and services for the tertiary hospital accounted for R239 million, 25% more than Charlotte Maxeke Academic Hospital, which is four times its size.</p>

<p>The whistleblower reported the splurge to department CFO Lerato Madyo and called for an immediate investigation and a stop on payments worth R104 million. Ten months after she was gunned down in a hit-style killing outside her south Johannesburg home, the payments out of the hospital have yet to be probed in their entirety.</p>

<h3>No investigation, no protection: Inside department head's big lie to Babita Deokaran</h3>

<p>Gauteng Health boss Lerato Madyo lied when she told Babita Deokaran that her discovery of R850m in dubious Tembisa Hospital payments had been bumped up the chain of command.</p>

<p>News24 can reveal that it was only on the day of Deokaran's assassination that Madyo mentioned to her superiors, in passing, that the whistleblower was worried her life was in danger after moving to halt payments to a politically connected businessman and hundreds of other companies.</p>

<p>Beyond this, the report in which Deokaran called for an urgent probe into the hospital's spending patterns was never formally escalated. Madyo received it three weeks before the murder.</p>

<h3>Tembisa Hospital contract factory: R500k on leather loungers and letterbox barons unmasked</h3>

<p>Tembisa Hospital bosses splurged R500 000 on 100 leather wingback chairs – this deal just one of a surge of dubious payments flagged by Babita Deokaran before she was assassinated. <br><br>A News24 investigation, drawing from key documents contained in thousands of Deokaran’s emails, can reveal that the East Rand hospital was turned into a contract factory. In four months, it processed more than 1 200 purchase orders worth more than R600 million.<br><br>While struggling with overcrowding, staff shortages and a dearth of funding, the hospital channelled nearly R60 million in payments to letterbox companies that exist only on paper. Twenty entities which simultaneously billed the hospital are controlled by four people. Each registered five companies on the same day and provided fake addresses when doing so.</p>

<p>Seventy payments to entities they own are among more than a thousand ""possibly fraudulent"" transactions flagged by Deokaran three weeks before she was assassinated.

<p>The overtures by ANC operatives came despite various requests for comment to Mthunzi on what Deokaran found at Tembisa Hospital. These requests have however gone unanswered.</p>

<h3>Tembisa Hospital’s R500 000 skinny jean spending spree... and the soccer star who scored</h3>

<p>The payment for 200 pairs of denims - for girls aged between 6 and 7 – was flagged by Babita Deokaran alongside thousands of other transactions out of the East Rand hospital worth more than R850 million. She was assassinated three weeks later.</p>

<p>A Gauteng health department audit of Tembisa Hospital launched after Babita Deokaran red-flagged R850 million in dodgy payments was buried for more than a year - and recommendations for an urgent investigation were abandoned.</p>

<p>Internal auditors found that hospital officials corrupted the procurement system and tampered with documents in order to channel contracts worth millions to companies which had been hand-picked to score big.</p>

<p>According to the confidential report filed in September last year, obtained by News24, auditors tested a random sample of just 18 individual payments – of 1 203 identified by Deokaran before her murder – and found that all were irregular.</p>

<p>Through a web of companies, Maumela and his cousin scored R36 million in trade from the East Rand hospital in a period spanning only weeks – the transactions among more than a thousand now under investigation by Special Investigating Unit (SIU).</p>

<p>News24 can also reveal that the businessman’s links to the Union Buildings run deeper, with ties to Ramaphosa’s right-hand - principal political advisor Bejani Chauke.

<p>After News24 exposed the hospital tender mafia, company directors inexplicably resigned en masse and ceded control to Govindraju. His takeover played out in less than 48 hours.</p>

<p>News24 can now reveal Govindraju’s connection to the companies - behind a flood of unregulated medical equipment sold to the hospital - as the final link in a chain of lovers, relatives, friends, and co-workers.</p>

<h3>SIU unravels R1 billion Tembisa tender syndicates</h3>

<p>The Special Investigating Unit (SIU) recommended Tembisa Hospital tender kingpins Hangwani Maumela and Stefan Govindraju – whose companies landed contracts worth R775 million in less than two years - face prosecution for fraud.</p>

<p>A preliminary SIU report released on Tuesday found that networks of shell corporations banked more than R1 billion in dubious payments from the impoverished hospital. These syndicates and those behind them were first exposed by News24 in a series titled Silenced.</p>

<p>Investigators uncovered evidence that Maumela and Govindraju, through companies they controlled, in some cases, provided fake documents to the Gauteng Department of Health which paved the way for a flood of payments.</p>

<h3>Tembisa Hospital's R500 000 chicken tender, and how the inside men feathered the nest</h3>

<p>Tembisa Hospital splurged R500 000 on six tons of frozen chicken in a deal tainted by irregularities, false documents and price inflation. This payment is one of hundreds now in the crosshairs of the Special Investigating Unit.</p>

<p>The graft-busting squad found that hospital officials flouted buying processes, a key enabler for a tender mafia first identified by Babita Deokaran three weeks before she was assassinated.</p>

<p>Those officials who swung dicey contracts are still at work, and some are still in charge of procurement.</p>

<p>The contract was awarded to an unknown company named Fairg Holdings, which operates from a rundown house in suburban Benoni on the East Rand.</p>

<p>SIU investigators concluded that falsified and altered documents were overlooked in order to close the deal - with a price nearly double what it should have been.</p>

<h3>Tembisa tender tycoon, his 'mama cat', and their brazen blue-light brigade</h3>

<p>Tembisa Hospital tender tycoon Vusimuzi Matlala – whose companies scored nearly R5 million in contracts red-flagged by Babita Deokaran – is now under investigation for his illegal blue-light cavalcade used for airport trips and school runs.</p>

<p>Matlala’s partner Cordelia Kabeng, calling herself ""mama cat"", boasted to her 12 000 Instagram followers about her high-speed escorts, replete with lights and sirens, to drop off her ""cubs"".</p>

<p>Matlala has close ties to Hangwani Morgan Maumela, the central node in an extraction syndicate of little-known companies and opaque trusts which saw R23 million in dicey payments channelled their way.</p>

<h3>Tembisa tender mafia: Syndicates expand, and look to other hospital feeding troughs</h3>

<p>Front company kingpin Stefan Govindraju - who controls a tender extraction network which bled R440 million from Tembisa Hospital - has been linked to more shady state suppliers, with worrying signals that the contract feeding frenzy stretches into other hospitals.</p>

<p>Five of his companies, outside of 217 ""possibly fraudulent"" entities red-flagged by Babita Deokaran before her assassination, are now under investigation by the Gauteng Department of Health after irregularities were discovered in the way they operate.</p>

<h2>'Are u ok?' Crucial Tembisa Hospital corruption evidence stolen</h2>

<p>Suspended Gauteng health department boss Lerato Madyo’s cellphone – a critical piece of evidence in a R850-million fraud and corruption probe into Tembisa Hospital – was stolen before cops could analyse it.</p>

<p>The phone – with its record of a WhatsApp chat between Madyo and <a href=""https://specialprojects.news24.com/silenced/index.html"">whistleblower Babita Deokaran</a> – was reported stolen in March last year.</p>

<p>In the weeks before she was murdered, Deokaran briefed Madyo about her concerns over Tembisa Hospital spending, fears that her life was in danger, and misgivings surrounding lucrative contracts scored by an ANC politician, according to a history of near-daily conversations, obtained by News24. <br></p>

<h2>'They took my phone': Hawks raid ANC bigwig in R1bn Tembisa corruption scandal</h2>

<p>Flashy ANC boss Sello Sekhokho and his fleet of companies - that scored nearly R100 million in shady contracts from Gauteng hospitals in just three years – are in the crosshairs of a R1-billion Tembisa Hospital fraud and corruption probe.</p>

<p>Early on Wednesday morning, Hawks detectives swooped on Sekhokho's home and two properties from which he runs his business empire, seizing documents, computers and cellphones.</p>

<p>A company named Kaizen Projects – controlled by the 37-year-old politician – was among the first of 217 entities redflagged by whistleblower Babita Deokaran, after she noticed a surge in spending out of Tembisa Hospital. Three weeks after she reported concerns over the legitimacy of the company and others, she was assassinated outside her home.<br></p>

<h2>R250m Tembisa Hospital extraction syndicate is still scoring tenders</h2>

<p>A company that forms part of the extraction syndicate which banked R250 million in shady Tembisa Hospital contracts, was paid nearly R1 million by the Gauteng Department of Health – after it was red-flagged by the Special Investigating Unit.</p>

<p>The little-known company called Minzorex scored two contracts from Edenvale Hospital and was paid R985 100 in two transactions – the last lump sum landing in the firm's bank account in January.  <br></p>

<h2>The big score: Tembisa tender kings 'inflated' prices for embattled hospital by up to 2 000%</h2>

<p>Gauteng Department of Health boss Lerato Madyo and Tembisa Hospital CEO Ashley Mthunzi signed off on medical supply contracts with grossly inflated prices, overlooking a litany of discrepancies, including forged documents.</p>

<p>In one instance, the price of surgical drapes was gouged by nearly 2 000%.</p>

<p>Last month, the pair were each charged with misconduct during internal disciplinary action arising from 13 transactions they approved, among more than a thousand dubious payments flagged by provincial financial manager Babita Deokaran before her murder. They both now face dismissal if found guilty.</p>

<p>Now nearly 900 pages of documentary evidence, which underpins misconduct allegations, have been filed in the disciplinary inquiry. This trove of bid documents, quotes and purchase orders reveal how easily supply chain management prescripts were flouted and bypassed, and how prices soared.</p>

<h2>'Fraud', 'forgery' and Tembisa tender kingpin's 300% markup: This is how he did it</h2>

<p>Three companies with secret ties to front company kingpin Stefan Govindraju bid against one another for a lucrative Tembisa Hospital deal - the tainted contract now linked to a R440-million tender extraction syndicate.</p>

<p>This deal saw Tembisa Hospital pay 300% more than they should have for sutures, News24 can reveal.</p>

<p>In another, a company linked to Govindraju submitted forged documents which allowed them to win a supply contract for ventilator parts worth R496 000. These dubious transactions are among thousands of payments flagged by Babita Deokaran just weeks before she was assassinated outside her home.<br></p>

<h2>'I know nothing': How a pool cleaner, unemployed guard were used to 'cook' Tembisa tenders</h2>

<p>Two Limpopo women, one a municipal worker and the other an unemployed security guard, became unwitting bedfellows when their ""stolen"" identities were used in a scheme to rig a lucrative Tembisa Hospital contract, News24 can reveal.</p>

<p>Raesibe Motebejano spends her days cleaning the Polokwane Municipality's public swimming pools. The 44-year-old's signature also appears on bid documents for an entity called Black AK Trading and Suppliers, which tendered for a supplier contract from the East Rand Hospital.</p>

<h2>Tembisa tender 'don's' luxury properties flash sale and the realtors who kept it 'secret'</h2>

<p>Tembisa Hospital tender ""don"" Hangwani Morgan Maumela is selling off chunks of his R280 million property portfolio in a hurry – and a boutique real estate agency has seemingly helped him avoid the prying eyes of the Special Investigating Unit.</p>

<p>Maumela – President Cyril Ramaphosa's nephew from a previous marriage – was named by the SIU as a central figure in a R1 billion extraction scheme at the healthcare facility. A network of companies tied to Maumela and hundreds of payments from Tembisa Hospital were first discovered by Babita Deokaran before she was assassinated in August 2021.</p>

<p>News24 can reveal that in one property deal, the R14 million sale of a Hurlingham mansion in April, Live Real Estate and agents Brendan Miller and Jacqui Steinmann allegedly knew that Maumela was under investigation by the SIU – and pushed the sale in secret. <br></p>

"","As retirement approaches, many individuals face the important decision of whether to rent or buy a home. Each option comes with its own set of benefits and challenges, and understanding these can help retirees make informed decisions.

Richard Gray, CEO of Harcourts South Africa, offers valuable insights into navigating the real estate options available for retirees.

The Flexibility of Renting

Renting can provide retirees with the flexibility to choose where they want to live without the long-term commitment of homeownership. This is particularly appealing for those who may wish to relocate or downsize as their needs change. ""Renting allows retirees to enjoy different environments and lifestyles without the burden of property maintenance,"" says Gray.

Financial Considerations of Renting

While renting may seem less financially burdensome initially, retirees should consider the long-term implications. Monthly rental payments do not build equity, which can be a disadvantage for those looking to invest in their future. ""It’s essential for retirees to weigh the cost of renting against potential returns on investment when considering their financial security,"" advises Gray.

The Stability of Buying

Buying a home can offer retirees a sense of stability and long-term investment potential. Homeownership allows retirees to build equity over time and may provide financial benefits, such as potential appreciation in property value. ""For many, owning a home is a way to ensure a secure living situation during retirement,"" notes Gray.

Maintenance and Upkeep

One of the significant advantages of renting is that maintenance and repair costs typically fall to the landlord. This can be a relief for retirees who may not wish to handle the responsibilities of home maintenance. ""Tenants can enjoy peace of mind knowing that they won't face unexpected repair costs,"" Gray explains.

Lifestyle Factors

Lifestyle preferences also play a crucial role in the decision between renting and buying. Some retirees may prefer the social opportunities and amenities offered by rental communities, while others may wish to invest in a home that they can personalise. ""Understanding your lifestyle priorities is key to making the right choice,"" advises Gray.

Tax Implications

Buying a home can offer tax advantages, such as deductions on mortgage interest and property taxes. Retirees should consult with financial advisors to understand how ownership may impact their tax situation. ""It’s important to consider how these factors can influence your overall financial health,"" notes Gray.

Future Plans and Mobility

Retirees should also consider their future plans and mobility needs. For those who wish to travel or spend time in different locations, renting may provide the flexibility they desire. Conversely, individuals seeking to settle down in a specific community may find that buying is the best option for their long-term happiness. ""Assessing your lifestyle goals is crucial in this decision-making process,"" Gray says.

As retirees navigate the decision between renting and buying, Harcourts South Africa encourages them to consider their financial situation, lifestyle preferences, and long-term goals. By understanding the pros and cons of each option, retirees can make informed decisions that best suit their needs.

When selecting a retirement home, Nadia Aucamp, Broker Owner at RE/MAX All Stars suggests that it is crucial to consider the following factors:

Affordability: Retirees should ensure they don’t overcommit financially, particularly if they are no longer earning a regular income. Additional features are important but should only be considered if they fit within the budget.

Local amenities: Is the home close to essential services such as hospitals, shopping centres, and airports? Access to these facilities becomes even more important as one ages.

Size and maintenance: A smaller, low-maintenance home can reduce stress. Many retirees prefer homes that require minimal upkeep, so living in a complex might be more manageable than living in a free-standing home.

Guest accommodations: If you’re moving away from family, consider whether you need a guest room for visits from loved ones.

Care options: Will assisted care be necessary either now or in the near future? If so, a retirement village or old-age home might be a better fit.

“Security also remains a top priority for retirees, with many seeking homes in secure communities. Among the most popular choices are sectional title properties, as the levies cover outside maintenance, easing the burden on the homeowner. Ground-floor units with private gardens are especially desirable, making mobility easier as stairs can become more challenging with age. Additionally, pet-friendly properties are a must for those with furry companions,” says Aucamp.

Other desirable features that tend to work well for this age group include frail care facilities, tennis courts, paddle courts, and wellness programs like yoga classes are especially popular. “Shuttle services, on-site laundry, and even a hairdresser add tremendous value, making life more comfortable and convenient for retirees,” she adds.

“The process of selling a long-time family home and buying a new one can be emotionally and logistically challenging. Providing support during this transition, whether through family or professional guidance, can make the experience smoother and less stressful,” she says.","<article>

<p>As retirement approaches, many individuals face the important decision of whether to rent or buy a home. Each option comes with its own set of benefits and challenges, and understanding these can help retirees make informed decisions.</p>

<p>Richard Gray, CEO of <a href=""https://www.property24.com/estate-agents/harcourts/g14"" title=""Agencies part of Harcourts"">Harcourts</a> South Africa, offers valuable insights into navigating the real estate options available for retirees.</p>

<p><strong> The Flexibility of Renting</strong></p>

<p>Renting can provide retirees with the flexibility to choose where they want to live without the long-term commitment of homeownership. This is particularly appealing for those who may wish to relocate or downsize as their needs change. ""Renting allows retirees to enjoy different environments and lifestyles without the burden of property maintenance,"" says Gray.</p>

<p><strong> Financial Considerations of Renting</strong></p>

<p>While renting may seem less financially burdensome initially, retirees should consider the long-term implications. Monthly rental payments do not build equity, which can be a disadvantage for those looking to invest in their future. ""It’s essential for retirees to weigh the cost of renting against potential returns on investment when considering their financial security,"" advises Gray.</p>

<p><strong> The Stability of Buying</strong></p>

<p>Buying a home can offer retirees a sense of stability and long-term investment potential. Homeownership allows retirees to build equity over time and may provide financial benefits, such as potential appreciation in property value. ""For many, owning a home is a way to ensure a secure living situation during retirement,"" notes Gray.</p>

<p><strong> Maintenance and Upkeep</strong></p>

<p>One of the significant advantages of renting is that maintenance and repair costs typically fall to the landlord. This can be a relief for retirees who may not wish to handle the responsibilities of home maintenance. ""Tenants can enjoy peace of mind knowing that they won't face unexpected repair costs,"" Gray explains.</p>

<p><strong> Lifestyle Factors</strong></p>

<p>Lifestyle preferences also play a crucial role in the decision between renting and buying. Some retirees may prefer the social opportunities and amenities offered by rental communities, while others may wish to invest in a home that they can personalise. ""Understanding your lifestyle priorities is key to making the right choice,"" advises Gray.</p>

<p><strong> Tax Implications</strong></p>

<p>Buying a home can offer tax advantages, such as deductions on mortgage interest and property taxes.

"","Selling a home can be a challenging endeavour, especially when your property lingers on the market longer than anticipated. While there are several common pitfalls that can hinder the sale of your home, these are also easily avoided with the right knowledge and guidance from a reliable property professional.

Adrian Goslett, Regional Director and CEO of RE/MAX of Southern Africa, says that on average, a well-priced home in good condition in an active market should sell within three months or less. “If a property remains unsold for more than six months, it may be due to overpricing, required repairs, or ineffective marketing strategies,” he explains.

However, Goslett also cautions that these figures can fluctuate based on current market conditions and regional demand. “Collaborating with a knowledgeable real estate professional can provide tailored insights into local market conditions to help gain a better understanding of how long it should take to sell properties in your area,” he notes.

For those who have been struggling to sell for some time now, RE/MAX of Southern Africa shares some of the common issues and provides expert advice on how to address them…

Overpricing
One of the most significant mistakes sellers make is setting an unrealistic price. Overpricing can deter potential buyers who might not even consider viewing your property if it's beyond their budget. Overpricing can make other properties appear more attractive: ""All overestimated prices will do is make properties that are priced correctly look like a bargain buy,"" says Goslett.

Solution: Rely on the advice and guidance of your real estate professional on, especially if a price reduction is needed. “Reducing the price multiple times in small increments may signal desperation to buyers. It might be better to make one significant reduction to hit a new price bracket, opening your property up to a fresh pool of buyers who may not have seen it previously,” Goslett recommends

Property damages & poor presentation

First impressions matter. Homes that are cluttered, poorly staged, or in need of repairs can be a major turn-off for buyers. Cracks and other structural issues will also be a major red flag to most buyers. Unless the home has been priced correctly to factor in the required repairs a buyer will need to undertake, it is unlikely to attract a willing buyer.

Solution: Ensure your home is clean, decluttered, and any necessary repairs are addressed before listing. Major renovations aren’t necessarily required. Just ensure that the home is neat and presentable – a blank (and structurally sound) canvas for buyers to envision themselves in.

Choosing the wrong real estate agent

Not all agents have the same level of experience or resources. An unreliable agent who is difficult to reach and who fails to keep you informed of the activities being undertaken to actively market your home can hinder your home's visibility and attractiveness in the market.

Solution: Hire a reputable real estate agent with a proven track record in your area. When you find this agent, sign a sole mandate with them. It may seem counterintuitive, but an open mandate won’t offer the same motivation for the agent to sell the home. A sole mandate, which is set for a specific period, creates a sense of urgency for the agent to secure a sale before other agents can enter the picture.

While there are a few common pitfalls when it comes to the sale of your home, collaborating with a knowledgeable real estate professional can help you avoid these mistakes and provide tailored insights and strategies to expedite the sale of your property.

Here is a look back at the role of a real estate agent and what you need to know

According to the Seeff Property Group, (The role of a real estate agent : What you need to know) agents do not only sell or rent property on behalf of their clients, but also have their ear to the ground in terms of what current property values are, how much properties might sell for, and what is happening in the property market.

With so many newcomers to the market, often making lofty promises of high prices and quick sales, it is easy for sellers to get caught up in the hype. A property which simply sits on the market with no or low offers can be very frustrating for buyers.

The role of a good agent in getting your property sold as fast as possible, and for the best possible price cannot be overstated, says Samuel Seeff, chairman of Seeff. A bad agent could leave you with a lengthy and frustrating sale process.

Regardless of when you are selling, it is important to ensure you choose the right agent for your property and market. If you are not aware of who the best agents in your area are, ask around for recommendations from neighbours or friends.

Always meet the agents in person before appointing them:

This will give you a chance to ask questions and assess the agents. Check how long they have operated in the area. Each area is different and local expertise is a vital point of advantage for any seller.

Look for a successful sales track record:

Ask for a list of their recent sales in the area, how long it took to sell, and the prices achieved. A strong sales record is an important indicator of the likelihood of success and that the agent could find the right buyer for the property.

A strong brand and network is another advantage:

An established brand will have a strong online presence for maximum exposure of your property backed by the latest technology and marketing and sales methodologies. They will use best practice to market and sell your property.

Look for someone who will assist every step of the way:

Selling a property is a complex process with many legalities to be taken care of. A good agent will explain the process and guide the seller to ensure they have all the necessary documents and maintenance done for an efficient selling process.

Choosing the right agent to sell your home cannot be over-emphasised, especially if you are selling right now as you will not want to waste time, says Seeff. Choose the right agent and ensure you follow their advice.","<article>

"","One of the major expenses beyond the purchase price of a home is transfer costs and bond registration fees. It can take time to save up enough to cover these upfront costs, so the sooner buyers start thinking about this, the better.

“Buying a home is a significant financial commitment, and many first-time buyers often overlook the additional costs involved in the process. Understanding these costs and planning for them in advance can help you avoid financial strain when it comes time to finalise your property purchase,” advises Adrian Goslett, Regional Director and CEO of RE/MAX of Southern Africa.

He explains that when purchasing a property, buyers are responsible for covering the transfer duty (if applicable), conveyancing fees, and bond registration costs. These costs vary based on the purchase price of the property and the size of the home loan.

For example, if you are purchasing a home for R1.5 million, the estimated costs are as follows:

Transfer duty: R 12 000
Property transfer costs: R 35 392
Transfer deeds office fees: R 1 544
Post, petties FICA, other fees: R 2 000
Total transfer costs: R 50 936

Bond registration cost: R 35 392
Bond deeds office fees: R 1 544
Post, petties FICA, other fees: R 2 000
Total bond costs: R 38 936

Total additional costs: ±R 89 872

These costs need to be paid upfront and typically cannot be included in your home loan. If you do not have enough savings to cover these costs, you might have to consider a personal loan or bridging finance options.

“Financing these costs will carry additional interest charges and will require monthly instalments in addition to the home loan repayments. For these reasons, it is far better to cover these costs from savings rather than debt,” Goslett suggests.

To help buyers create a plan for how to cover these costs in cash, RE/MAX of Southern Africa shares the below tips:

Start early
As soon as you decide to buy a home, begin setting aside money for transfer fees.

Set up a dedicated savings account
Open a separate savings account specifically for your home-buying costs. Look for high-interest savings accounts or investment options that can help your money grow while you save. Keeping this money separate will also prevent you from accidentally spending it on other expenses.

Ask about special deals or discounts
Some banks offer incentives, such as covering or discounting the bond registration fees, if they are trying to beat quotes provided by other banks – that’s why it’s so important to shop around or to work through a bond originator to ensure that you get the best deal on your home loan. Don’t be shy to ask your transferring attorney for discounts either - be sure to explore your options and negotiate where possible.

“Being financially prepared for transfer fees ensures a smooth and stress-free property purchase process. By understanding the costs involved and implementing a dedicated savings plan, you can confidently take the next step towards homeownership without unexpected financial strain. Start saving today so that when the time comes, you’ll be ready to secure your dream home with ease,” says Goslett.

Understanding title deeds and the transfer process is key when buying property. According to Quay1 International Realty the title deed is the official legal document proving ownership, and the transfer of property is officially completed once it is registered with the Deeds Office.

There are various aspects that buyers should be aware of:

The conveyancing process is managed by attorneys selected by the seller, ensuring compliance with all legal requirements.
Transfer costs and fees are the responsibility of the buyer.
The process may take up to three months, depending on factors such as bank approvals, compliance certificates, and Deeds Office processing times.
Before finalising a purchase, it's crucial to verify property details, including ownership history, servitudes, and any restrictions.

Working with the right professionals ensures a smooth transfer, protecting your investment and ensuring a hassle-free transaction.

Before any transfer of property can occur, various compliance certificates will need to be issued. These include electric, plumbing, gas, beetle, and electric fence certificates.

The seller is required to pass the home inspection process to make sure that all these areas of the home are up to code. If not, sellers are responsible to cover the costs of addressing any issues that are pointed out for the certificate to be issued.","<article>

"","Pastor Timothy Omotoso is a free man after he was acquitted of multiple rape and human trafficking charges in the Eastern Cape High Court in Gqeberha on Wednesday.
Omotoso had been behind bars for eight years following his arrest in April 2017.
He will be deported to Nigeria immediately.

After eight years behind bars on more than 60 charges ranging from rape, sexual assault, and human trafficking, Nigerian televangelist Pastor Timothy Omotoso is a free man – and the judge presiding over the case has laid the blame squarely at the prosecution's feet.

Omotoso, the leader of the Jesus Dominion International Church, and his co-accused, Lusanda Sulani and Zukiswa Sitho, were acquitted of all charges in the Eastern Cape High Court in Gqeberha on Wednesday.

He will be deported to Nigeria immediately.

The trio previously faced 63 charges, ranging from rape and trafficking in persons for sexual purposes to sexual assault and racketeering.

However, they eventually only faced 32 charges after their acquittal on 31 charges in October 2023 because the State had not led evidence on those charges.

In her judgment, Judge Irma Schoeman severely criticised the State's handling of the case, concluding that the State had not proved its case beyond reasonable doubt.

Schoeman referred to the State's cross-examination of the three accused, saying it ""was as if the cross-examination never even took place"".

She stated that the trial was set out for nine days to deal with the evidence of the defence.

Omotoso testified for a whole day setting out his defence but the cross-examination lasted less than a morning session.

""He was not cross-examined on his denial with reference to the complainants' testimonies. No attempt was made to elicit inconsistencies or improbabilities. The cross-examination was shallow, lacking the intention to uncover the truth,"" she said.

""Similarly ineffective and superficial was the cross-examination of [Sulani and Sitho] that amounted to no cross-examination at all,"" she added.

Schoeman explained that although she did not necessarily believe the evidence of the accused, the onus was on the State to prove that the accused were guilty, not on the accused to convince the court they were innocent.

Schoeman also referred to the ""irregularities"" committed by advocate Nceba Ntelwa, the former lead prosecutor in the case, which essentially corrupted the trial and rendered it unfair.

During the trial, it was mentioned numerous times that Ntelwa allegedly encouraged witnesses to perjure themselves to secure a conviction and apparently told one of the witnesses not to deviate from her police statement, in which she did not mention an alleged rape, although she informed a fellow prosecutor about it.

Ntelwa is currently the prosecutor handling the Fort Hare University corruption case, where 16 people are accused of defrauding the university of a combined amount of R171 million.

According to Schoeman, Ntelwa, at one stage, told the court that he did not know that ""digital penetration"" constituted rape.

""It is inconceivable that a prosecutor with 14 years' experience that is involved in a case where rape is one of the charges the accused faces does not know what the definition of rape is. This is either extremely incompetent or dishonest,"" she said.

She added that action should have been taken against Ntelwa the moment these irregularities came to light, especially since his conduct was one of the reasons the trial, which started in July 2019, had faced so many delays.

The prosecutors were replaced more than once, and Schoeman took over the case after the previous judge had recused himself, resulting in another delay.

Moments after the judgment was delivered, a supporter in the public gallery shouted a resounding ""Yes!"" which led to gasps and reprimanding looks from court orderlies.

In a matter of seconds, Omotoso, Sulani, and Sitho jumped up from the dock, fell to their knees, and started praying aloud as the crowd of supporters outside the courtroom erupted into songs and cheers.

While supporters in the courtroom gathered around Omotoso to congratulate him, a key State witness, Cheryl Zondi, burst into tears.

She was whisked away by family and friends, who were all in tears.

Speaking to the media shortly after his acquittal, Omotoso said he ""thanked God"" for what had happened.

""I have been in prison for eight years. I think it is time for me to rest a bit. God will decide what I must do next,"" he said.

Candice Bezuidenhout

National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) regional spokesperson Luxolo Tyali said the NPA would explore other legal avenues since the trio was acquitted due to ""a technicality; mainly that the former prosecutors in the case acted improperly and the State did not sufficiently cross-examine the accused"".

""In as much as the NPA does not seek to secure conviction at all costs, it remains committed to ensuring justice is served for the victims of crime and will go to all lengths to give a voice to the victims by exploring all the possible avenues,"" he said.

Eastern Cape MEC for Social Development Bukiwe Fanta expressed her disappointment at the trial's outcome.

""The acquittal of the accused is a painful reminder of the systemic issues within our justice system that continue to hinder the pursuit of justice for victims of sexual violence. Each case of acquittal not only impacts the victims but also sends a troubling message to our society about the seriousness of these crimes,"" Fanta said.","<article>

<p>During the trial, it was mentioned numerous times that Ntelwa allegedly encouraged witnesses to perjure themselves to secure a conviction and apparently told one of the witnesses not to deviate from her police statement, in which she did not mention an alleged rape, although she informed a fellow prosecutor about it.</p>

<p>Ntelwa is currently the prosecutor handling the Fort Hare University corruption case, where 16 people are accused of defrauding the university of a combined amount of R171 million.</p>

<p>According to Schoeman, Ntelwa, at one stage, told the court that he did not know that ""digital penetration"" constituted rape.</p>

<p>""It is inconceivable that a prosecutor with 14 years' experience that is involved in a case where rape is one of the charges the accused faces does not know what the definition of rape is. This is either extremely incompetent or dishonest,"" she said.</p>

<p>She added that action should have been taken against Ntelwa the moment these irregularities came to light, especially since his conduct was one of the reasons the trial, which started in July 2019, had faced so many delays.</p>

<p>The prosecutors were replaced more than once, and Schoeman took over the case after the previous judge had recused himself, resulting in another delay.</p>

<p>Moments after the judgment was delivered, a supporter in the public gallery shouted a resounding ""Yes!"" which led to gasps and reprimanding looks from court orderlies.</p>

<p>In a matter of seconds, Omotoso, Sulani, and Sitho jumped up from the dock, fell to their knees, and started praying aloud as the crowd of supporters outside the courtroom erupted into songs and cheers.</p>

<p>While supporters in the courtroom gathered around Omotoso to congratulate him, a key State witness, Cheryl Zondi, burst into tears.</p>

<p>She was whisked away by family and friends, who were all in tears.</p>

<p>Speaking to the media shortly after his acquittal, Omotoso said he ""thanked God"" for what had happened.</p>

<p>""I have been in prison for eight years. I think it is time for me to rest a bit. God will decide what I must do next,"" he said.</p>

<p>National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) regional spokesperson Luxolo Tyali said the NPA would explore other legal avenues since the trio was acquitted due to ""a technicality; mainly that the former prosecutors in the case acted improperly and the State did not sufficiently cross-examine the accused"".</p>

<p>""In as much as the NPA does not seek to secure conviction at all costs, it remains committed to ensuring justice is served for the victims of crime and will go to all lengths to give a voice to the victims by exploring all the possible avenues,"" he said.</p>

<p>Eastern Cape MEC for Social Development Bukiwe Fanta expressed her disappointment at the trial's outcome.</p>

<p>""The acquittal of the accused is a painful reminder of the systemic issues within our justice system that continue to hinder the pursuit of justice for victims of sexual violence. Each case of acquittal not only impacts the victims but also sends a troubling message to our society about the seriousness of these crimes,"" Fanta said.</p>

Destiny by Malaika, which was one of the hits where the gents who were part of the group stepped back and let Tshedi Mholo take the spotlight, the late Tsakani Mhinga’s How Do You Feel, Zamajobe’s Ndawo Yami and other blasts from the past that were carried by Mzansi’s women in music accompanied the proceedings.

The music left programme director and former SABC 1 continuity presenter Zandi Nhlapo feeling like she was in a high school reunion, asking guests to think back to where they were 30 years ago.

Multiple guests lamented absence of support, asking why a first of its kind music platform in South Africa and second to ever grace African stages after Senegal’s Only Women Music Awards that were launched in 1994 was not televised.

Modise, who was draped in a black and white gown with sketches of the 90s queens’ faces, has spent many years giving the spotlight to women in the music industry and using her own resources to elevate previous generations of artists.

She recalled being accused of relishing in “Hlala kwabafileyo” by naysayers, which did not sit right with numerous guests. Hlala Kwabafileyo was a television drama in the 90s about a deceased man who refused to stay dead.

Said Nhlapo:

Hlala Kwabafileyo is very condescending and disrespectful because those people are implying that Miriam Makeba, Abigal Kubeka, Lilian Dube and other women who are part of our musical history should be forgotten. They are saying that these women’s contributions should not be celebrated but the landscape of various local art forms looks the way it does because the baton was passed down.

This was alluded to by the printed poem that awaited guests at their tables that was co-written by Modise and Mpumi Zulu.

The untitled piece read:

Through the noise, you found your voice

Making space for us, giving us choice

From the riot girls to the TV screens

You painted the world with new unseen dreams.

Basadi in Music Awards Presents the Queens of the Legends Gala Dinner https://t.co/3HmvXy3ogG pic.twitter.com/FJSUldhRC3

— Orgella Entertainment (@orgellaent) March 24, 2025

The first woman chairperson of the United Nations and former cooperative governance and traditional affairs minister, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, who was honoured for being a visionary said it was special to be celebrated by South African women.

Dlamini-Zuma lamented history being documented in ways that deliberately omit the role of women, saying often women would get to be a footnote at the bottom … if they were lucky.

Naledi Pandor was honoured for the bold stand she took against Israel in the International Court of Justice case and reminding young people about the importance of education by returning to the classroom to obtain her PhD in education when she headed that ministry.

90s South African queen of talk Felicia Mabuza-Suttle dedicated her award to fallen sheroes, living legends and contemporary artists in her acceptance video, saying how much she missed South Africa.

Former Khumbulekhaya presenter and Abuti O hitmaker Andile Gaelesiwe who had no awards to her name before Thursday evening said:

Whoever says hlala kwabafileyo it's because yena ufile (they are dead). As a woman I want to say if you don’t write that book, sing that song or host that podcast you are depriving humanity of your greatness.

Expressing her gratitude for the women celebratory work that Modise puts out, Mholo said there was no better person to document women’s stories than women as this demographic knew itself best.

She cautioned against the “male dominated industry” vocabulary, saying continuing with utterings of this nature was counterproductive to dismantling these systems.

She advised women to tread carefully in spaces where being emotional, which is part of the human journey, is villainised.

However, she added that the contributions made by women can no longer be ignored because of how sizeable they were.

Said Mholo:

The arts and entertainment space at large has been quite patriarchal and women needed a voice so as women we have been waiting for a platform such as the one Hloni has created. I’m happy that it’s happening while I’m still alive.

She advised the younger generation of women in music to never lose sight of the reasons why they entered this industry and to be cognisant of “vibes” as these can potentially derail them from their objectives and sense of self.

“There’s a legacy to build, there are history books to be written and the manner in which you conduct yourself as a brand is important when people are documenting your story,” she asserted.

Among the over 30 Celebrated 90s Queens were:

KB Motsilenyane

Sharon Dee

Boom Shaka’s Thembi Seete and the late Lebo Mathosa

Khanyo Maphumulo

TK Mhinga

Thandiswa Mazwai

Claire Johnston

Margaret Motsage

<p>The first woman chairperson of the United Nations and former cooperative governance and traditional affairs minister, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, who was honoured for being a visionary said it was special to be celebrated by South African women.</p>

<p>Dlamini-Zuma lamented history being documented in ways that deliberately omit the role of women, saying often women would get to be a footnote at the bottom … if they were lucky.</p>

<p>Naledi Pandor was honoured for the bold stand she took against Israel in the International Court of Justice case and reminding young people about the importance of education by returning to the classroom to obtain her PhD in education when she headed that ministry.</p>

<p>90s South African queen of talk Felicia Mabuza-Suttle dedicated her award to fallen sheroes, living legends and contemporary artists in her acceptance video, saying how much she missed South Africa.</p>

<p>Former Khumbulekhaya presenter and Abuti O hitmaker Andile Gaelesiwe who had no awards to her name before Thursday evening said:</p>

<blockquote>Whoever says hlala kwabafileyo it's because yena ufile (they are dead). As a woman I want to say if you don’t write that book, sing that song or host that podcast you are depriving humanity of your greatness.</blockquote>

<p>Expressing her gratitude for the women celebratory work that Modise puts out, Mholo said there was no better person to document women’s stories than women as this demographic knew itself best.</p>

<p>She cautioned against the “male dominated industry” vocabulary, saying continuing with utterings of this nature was counterproductive to dismantling these systems.</p>

<p>She advised women to tread carefully in spaces where being emotional, which is part of the human journey, is villainised.</p>

<p>However, she added that the contributions made by women can no longer be ignored because of how sizeable they were.</p>

<p>Said Mholo:</p>

<blockquote>The arts and entertainment space at large has been quite patriarchal and women needed a voice so as women we have been waiting for a platform such as the one Hloni has created. I’m happy that it’s happening while I’m still alive.</blockquote>

<p>She advised the younger generation of women in music to never lose sight of the reasons why they entered this industry and to be cognisant of “vibes” as these can potentially derail them from their objectives and sense of self.</p>

<p>“There’s a legacy to build, there are history books to be written and the manner in which you conduct yourself as a brand is important when people are documenting your story,” she asserted.</p>
