Your next career opportunity might just be around the corner!","articleBody":"Embrace the possibility of change and the potential it holds for new adventures and achievements. Your next career opportunity might just be around the corner!\n\nNavigating the professional landscape can be challenging, and knowing when it’s time to leave your current job is a crucial skill for career growth and personal satisfaction. If you’re feeling restless or unfulfilled, it might be a sign that your current role no longer aligns with your goals or values. Here’s how to recognise the tell-tale signs that it’s time to make your next career move.\n\n1. You Dread Going to Work\n\nIf the thought of going to work fills you with anxiety or dread, it’s a clear signal that something isn’t right. While everyone has off days, consistent feelings of unhappiness or stress are red flags. This emotional drain can significantly impact your overall well-being and productivity.\n\nAction Step: Reflect on what specifically causes these feelings. Is it the workload, the company culture, or a lack of passion for the job itself? Understanding the root cause can help you decide your next steps.\n\n2. Lack of Growth Opportunities\n\nIn a fulfilling career, there should always be room for growth and development. If you find that there are no opportunities for advancement or learning new skills, you might feel stuck and uninspired.\n\nAction Step: Have a conversation with your manager about your career aspirations. If there’s no clear path for growth, it might be time to explore new opportunities where your skills and ambitions are valued.\n\n3. Your Values No Longer Align\n\nAs you progress in your career, your personal values and goals may evolve. If you find that your company’s mission, culture, or ethical practices no longer align with your own, it can lead to a sense of disconnection and dissatisfaction.\n\nAction Step: Re-evaluate your personal and professional values. Seek out companies that align more closely with your beliefs and where you can feel more integrated and purposeful.\n\n4. You’re Underappreciated or Overworked\n\nFeeling undervalued, consistently overworked, or underpaid are common reasons people decide to move on. When your efforts are not recognised or rewarded, it can lead to burnout and resentment.\n\nAction Step: Assess your current workload and compensation. Have an open discussion with your manager about your concerns and seek recognition or rewards that match your contributions. If the response is unsatisfactory, consider looking for a more appreciative work environment.\n\n5. Toxic Work Environment\n\nA toxic work environment can have a detrimental effect on your mental and physical health. Signs include poor communication, constant negativity, lack of support, and workplace bullying.\n\nAction Step: Document specific instances of toxic behaviour and consider speaking with HR or a trusted advisor within the company. If the environment does not improve, prioritising your health and well-being by seeking a healthier workplace is crucial.\n\n6. You’re No Longer Learning\n\nIf you’re not learning anything new and your daily tasks feel monotonous, it could indicate that you’ve outgrown your current role. Continuous learning and challenges are essential for professional satisfaction and growth.\n\nAction Step: Identify areas where you’d like to grow and seek out new projects or responsibilities within your current role. If opportunities are limited, it may be time to find a position that offers more growth potential.\n\n7. Your Gut Tells You It’s Time\n\nSometimes, your intuition is the best guide. If you have a persistent feeling that it’s time to move on, it’s worth listening to that inner voice.\n\nAction Step: Trust your instincts and start exploring new opportunities. Networking, updating your resume, and researching companies can provide new perspectives and options for your career.\n\nDeciding to leave a job is never easy, but recognising these signs can help you make a more informed and confident decision.

Your next career opportunity might just be around the corner!</p>\n\n<p>Navigating\nthe professional landscape can be challenging, and knowing when it’s time to\nleave your current job is a crucial skill for career growth and personal\nsatisfaction. If you’re feeling restless or unfulfilled, it might be a sign\nthat your current role no longer aligns with your goals or values. Here’s how\nto recognise the tell-tale signs that it’s time to make your next career move.</p>\n\n<p><strong>1.\nYou Dread Going to Work</strong></p>\n\n<p>If the\nthought of going to work fills you with anxiety or dread, it’s a clear signal\nthat something isn’t right. While everyone has off days, consistent feelings of\nunhappiness or stress are red flags. This emotional drain can significantly\nimpact your overall well-being and productivity.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Action\nStep:</strong> Reflect\non what specifically causes these feelings. Is it the workload, the company\nculture, or a lack of passion for the job itself? Understanding the root cause\ncan help you decide your next steps.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2.\nLack of Growth Opportunities</strong></p>\n\n<p>In a\nfulfilling career, there should always be room for growth and development. If\nyou find that there are no opportunities for advancement or learning new\nskills, you might feel stuck and uninspired.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Action\nStep:</strong> Have a\nconversation with your manager about your career aspirations. If there’s no\nclear path for growth, it might be time to explore new opportunities where your\nskills and ambitions are valued.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3.\nYour Values No Longer Align</strong></p>\n\n<p>As you\nprogress in your career, your personal values and goals may evolve. If you find\nthat your company’s mission, culture, or ethical practices no longer align with\nyour own, it can lead to a sense of disconnection and dissatisfaction.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Action\nStep:</strong>\nRe-evaluate your personal and professional values. Seek out companies that\nalign more closely with your beliefs and where you can feel more integrated and\npurposeful.</p>\n\n<p><strong>4.\nYou’re Underappreciated or Overworked</strong></p>\n\n<p>Feeling\nundervalued, consistently overworked, or underpaid are common reasons people\ndecide to move on. When your efforts are not recognised or rewarded, it can\nlead to burnout and resentment.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Action\nStep:</strong> Assess\nyour current workload and compensation. Have an open discussion with your\nmanager about your concerns and seek recognition or rewards that match your\ncontributions. If the response is unsatisfactory, consider looking for a more\nappreciative work environment.</p>\n\n<p><strong>5.\nToxic Work Environment</strong></p>\n\n<p>A toxic\nwork environment can have a detrimental effect on your mental and physical\nhealth. Signs include poor communication, constant negativity, lack of support,\nand workplace bullying.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Action\nStep</strong>: Document\nspecific instances of toxic behaviour and consider speaking with HR or a\ntrusted advisor within the company. If the environment does not improve,\nprioritising your health and well-being by seeking a healthier workplace is\ncrucial.</p>\n\n<p><strong>6.\nYou’re No Longer Learning</strong></p>\n\n<p>If\nyou’re not learning anything new and your daily tasks feel monotonous, it could\nindicate that you’ve outgrown your current role. Continuous learning and\nchallenges are essential for professional satisfaction and growth.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Action\nStep</strong>: Identify\nareas where you’d like to grow and seek out new projects or responsibilities\nwithin your current role. If opportunities are limited, it may be time to find\na position that offers more growth potential.</p>\n\n<p><strong>7.\nYour Gut Tells You It’s Time</strong></p>\n\n<p>Sometimes,\nyour intuition is the best guide. If you have a persistent feeling that it’s\ntime to move on, it’s worth listening to that inner voice.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Action\nStep:</strong> Trust\nyour instincts and start exploring new opportunities. Networking, updating your\nresume, and researching companies can provide new perspectives and options for\nyour career.</p>\n\n<p>Deciding\nto leave a job is never easy, but recognising these signs can help you make a\nmore informed and confident decision. Prioritise your happiness, growth, and\nwell-being by seeking opportunities that align with your evolving career goals\nand personal values. Remember, the right move can lead to a more fulfilling and\nprosperous career path.</p>\n\n<p>Embrace\nthe possibility of change and the potential it holds for new adventures and\nachievements. Your next career opportunity might just be around the corner!</p>\n\n</article>","url":"https://careeradvice.careers24.com/career-advice/job-hunting/time-to-move-on-here-are-the-signs-you-shouldnt-ignore-at-work-20240524","metadata":{"dateDownloaded":"2025-03-29T15:06:29Z","probability":0.9152773023},"_type":"Article"},{"headline":"Unmasking the Surprising Earning Potential of Blue-Collar Work in South Africa","inLanguage":"en","mainImage":{"url":"https://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/3530/459efff2cd404d07a032622aae24d1ac.jpeg"},"images":[{"url":"https://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/3530/459efff2cd404d07a032622aae24d1ac.jpeg"}],"description":"Often overshadowed by white-collar professions, blue-collar work in South Africa is beginning to garner the recognition it deserves. These manual labour jobs, which may not require a formal degree but demand skill, experience, and dedication, can often be quite lucrative.","articleBody":"1. The Upswing of Blue-Collar Work\n\nBlue-collar jobs, which typically involve manual labour in trades such as construction, manufacturing, or maintenance, have historically been undervalued compared to white-collar jobs. However, the perception is shifting, especially as the economy witnesses a growing demand for skilled workers in these sectors. South Africa, with its ongoing infrastructure projects and a burgeoning manufacturing sector, presents numerous opportunities for blue-collar workers.\n\n2. Earning Potential and Expected Salaries\n\nThe earning potential for blue-collar workers in South Africa can be quite surprising, particularly for those with specialised skills and years of experience. Let's explore some of these professions:\n\nElectricians\n\nA licensed electrician in South Africa can earn between R250,000 to R450,000 annually. Those who own their businesses or work as independent contractors can potentially earn even more. With a constant need for electrical maintenance, repairs, and installations in residential, commercial, and industrial settings, electricians' skills are always in demand.\n\nPlumbers\n\nPlumbers are another group of professionals whose skills are consistently required. They can earn an average salary of R200,000 to R400,000 annually. Plumbers with a specialisation, such as gas fitting or pipe laying, can command higher salaries. Like electricians, plumbers who own their own businesses or work independently can increase their earnings significantly.\n\nWelders\n\nWelding is a critical skill in many sectors, including construction, manufacturing, and shipbuilding. A skilled welder in South Africa can expect to earn between R150,000 and R350,000 per year. Highly experienced welders or those with specialist welding skills can earn even more.\n\nConstruction Managers\n\nConstruction is a booming industry in South Africa, and experienced construction managers are highly sought after. A construction manager can earn anywhere from R300,000 to R700,000 per year, depending on the complexity of the projects they oversee.\n\n3. The Future of Blue-Collar Work in South Africa\n\nThe future of blue-collar work in South Africa looks promising. With the country's ongoing development and a move towards industrialisation, skilled blue-collar workers will continue to be in high demand.\n\nMoreover, the South African government's commitment to infrastructure development and vocational training is likely to further boost opportunities in blue-collar sectors. Various initiatives aim to provide young South Africans with vocational training to fill these roles, ensuring a steady supply of skilled workers for these high-paying blue-collar jobs.\n\nThe surprising earning potential of blue-collar work in South Africa is a testament to the changing dynamics of the job market. The perception that only white-collar jobs offer attractive salaries is being challenged. Blue-collar professions, requiring skill, dedication, and often a good deal of physical labour, are offering competitive salaries and attractive career opportunities. This shift not only provides an avenue for financial stability for a wider range of workers but also helps to foster a more diverse and resilient economy.","articleBodyHtml":"<article>\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/3530/459efff2cd404d07a032622aae24d1ac.jpeg\" alt=\"blue collar\">\n\n    <figcaption><p>Often overshadowed by white-collar professions, blue-collar work in South Africa is beginning to garner the recognition it deserves.

Owing to her position, she was also in control of the evidentiary paper trail left by those who preyed on public funds, making her an invaluable asset to the Special Investigating Unit.\n\nA News24 investigation which spanned more than a year – examining in excess of 60 000 e-mails and the contents of her cellphone – can reveal the vivid detail of what was her final graft investigation.\n\nIn this series, titled Silenced, we reveal what she found in the days before her murder.\n\nBy News24 Investigations\n\nYour support affords us the time and resources to produce rich, in-depth journalism that matters.\n\nSubscribe to News24\n\n'Our lives could be in danger: Inside Babita Deokaran's R850m 'fraud' probe\n\nBabita Deokaran tried to stop R100 million in dodgy payments and flagged nearly R850 million in other suspicious transactions at the Gauteng Department of Health just days before she was killed - confiding in colleagues that her last investigation could result in her death.\n\n\"...I am just worried that the guys in Tembisa are going to realise we are not releasing their payments and know that we on to something. Our lives could be in danger,\" Deokaran said in a WhatsApp message to her boss.\n\nDeokaran - a senior manager at the Gauteng health department - was ambushed by hitmen outside her home in Winchester Hills, south Johannesburg. She was shot nine times while pulling into her driveway after dropping off her daughter at school and later died in hospital. Her murder put an end to a decade of cooperation with the Special Investigating Unit and the Hawks as a critical witness within her department.\n\nNearly a year after she was murdered - drawing from a trove of more than 60 000 emails and the contents of her cellphone - News24 can reveal details of her final graft probe.\n\nRead the story\n\nBabita Deokaran tried to stop ‘secret’ Tembisa Hospital payments to ANC leader\n\nThree little-known companies headed by Gauteng ANC heavyweight Sello Sekhokho scored contracts providing medical supplies and equipment to Tembisa Hospital worth R2.3 million - his windfall flagged as \"potentially fraudulent\" by Department of Health chief accountant Babita Deokaran just three weeks before she was murdered.\n\nOne firm - Kaizen Projects - is among a network of 217 entities Deokaran identified as part of a flood of transactions out of Tembisa Hospital, her suspicion piqued by a buying spree which shot expenditure in July of 2021 sharply up. In a single month, goods and services for the tertiary hospital accounted for R239 million, 25% more than Charlotte Maxeke Academic Hospital, which is four times its size.\n\nThe whistleblower reported the splurge to department CFO Lerato Madyo and called for an immediate investigation and a stop on payments worth R104 million. Ten months after she was gunned down in a hit-style killing outside her south Johannesburg home, the payments out of the hospital have yet to be probed in their entirety.\n\nRead the story\n\nNo investigation, no protection: Inside department head's big lie to Babita Deokaran\n\nGauteng Health boss Lerato Madyo lied when she told Babita Deokaran that her discovery of R850m in dubious Tembisa Hospital payments had been bumped up the chain of command.\n\nNews24 can reveal that it was only on the day of Deokaran's assassination that Madyo mentioned to her superiors, in passing, that the whistleblower was worried her life was in danger after moving to halt payments to a politically connected businessman and hundreds of other companies.\n\nBeyond this, the report in which Deokaran called for an urgent probe into the hospital's spending patterns was never formally escalated. Madyo received it three weeks before the murder.\n\nRead the story\n\nTembisa Hospital contract factory: R500k on leather loungers and letterbox barons unmasked\n\nTembisa Hospital bosses splurged R500 000 on 100 leather wingback chairs – this deal just one of a surge of dubious payments flagged by Babita Deokaran before she was assassinated.\nA News24 investigation, drawing from key documents contained in thousands of Deokaran’s emails, can reveal that the East Rand hospital was turned into a contract factory. In four months, it processed more than 1 200 purchase orders worth more than R600 million.\nWhile struggling with overcrowding, staff shortages and a dearth of funding, the hospital channelled nearly R60 million in payments to letterbox companies that exist only on paper. Twenty entities which simultaneously billed the hospital are controlled by four people. Each registered five companies on the same day and provided fake addresses when doing so.\n\nRead the story\n\nLove me tender: How husband and wife bagged R30m in Tembisa Hospital contracts\n\nA part-time call centre agent and her sound engineer husband landed Tembisa Hospital contracts worth nearly R30 million in the space of a month - part of a mammoth extraction network uncovered by murdered whistleblower Babita Deokaran.\n\nChristine and Avikash Signarian each control five companies that saw a flurry of trade from the hospital, contracted to provide everything from ventilators to ICU beds.\n\nSeventy payments to entities they own are among more than a thousand \"possibly fraudulent\" transactions flagged by Deokaran three weeks before she was assassinated. Her call for a forensic probe into the hospital’s buying patterns were ignored and payments worth R850 million are yet to be fully examined.\n\nRead the story\n\nUnder fire Tembisa hospital boss calls on ANC connections over News24 investigation\n\nThe Tembisa Hospital CEO, responsible for approving millions of rand in dodgy payments flagged by Babita Deokaran, has roped in his ANC connections because \"he is struggling with News24\".\n\nThis publication was contacted by a member of the ANC’s communications team on Tuesday to set up a meeting with hospital boss Ashley Mthunzi, after Mthunzi asked the convenor of the ANC’s Progressive Business Forum to intercede on his behalf.\n\nThe overtures by ANC operatives came despite various requests for comment to Mthunzi on what Deokaran found at Tembisa Hospital.

Most of these are not only great to add value to your life, but your property as well and could make it more attractive to buyers according to the Seeff Property Group.\n\nIf it is an older home and you have equity that you can leverage, then giving it a good make-over with a new kitchen and bathrooms could add value, but you could also just do a few cost-effective cosmetic upgrades. You should, however, always weigh the renovation costs against the benefit, and keep it neutral when you want to sell. Green walls and plenty of plants are great, but not everybody’s taste.\n\nIt is important to distinguish between what will add value to your lifestyle, and what will add value to your property. Recent sales prices in the area can provide insight into how much more your property could sell for with improvements, and prevent overcapitalising with extravagant additions or finishes which do not add extra value.\n\nTastes differ, so when the time comes to sell, consult with a local estate agent because you may need to tone down some of the colour, plants and décor to get the property sold. Always keep the upgrades in line with other properties in the area. The property should not stand out like a sore thumb in the neighbourhood.\n\nThat said, upgrading a property often starts a trend in the area and neighbours may follow suit, all of which will contribute to making the area more attractive to buyers who will often then be willing to pay more for a trendy home. Upgrades are a great way to turn rather drab areas into trendy neighbourhoods according to Seeff.\n\nSeeff’s agents highlight some cost-effective improvements which can increase the value and make the property more attractive to buyers.\n\nRepainting. New modern colours such as grey, green and even black are all the rage right now, but it does not have to be as dramatic as that. Even just upgrading the exterior and interior in new paint tones, albeit fairly neutral, can add value and could spark buyer interest.\n\nFloors and tiled areas. Floors can be modernised with wooden or laminate flooring, or feature tiles in the latest trends, or new carpets. Wall tiles can also be replaced to give an instant update to the appearance of the kitchen and bathrooms.\n\nKitchen and bathrooms. If you are unable to do a complete remodel, consider cosmetic upgrades such as painting the cupboards, fitting new handles, adding open shelves, a new stove and appliances, new bathroom fittings, new mirrors and new towels.\n\nDoors and bedroom cupboards. Another cost-effective way to upgrade is to change the door and cupboard handles given that there is now such a wide choice available. If the cupboards are old, you can repaint and modernise rather than replace.\n\nNew lighting and window coverings. You can also consider upgrading exterior and interior lighting to modernise the home. Upgrade your curtains or add American shutters or wooden blinds. You could also change from kirsch rails to rods to give it a modern touch.\n\nConvert your patio into a braai room. If you have a patio, consider enclosing it and adding a built-in braai, and sliding or stacking doors to open it to the garden. This will enable you to enjoy year-round braai get togethers regardless of the weather, and add value.\n\nUpdate the garden. Aside from general maintenance, you can add outdoor pots, or paint your pots or old garden furniture to give it a new lease on life. Adding pathways and garden décor can add interest to the garden.\n\nHere is a look back at some of David Jacobs', Gauteng Regional Manager for the Rawson Property Group, favourite DIY home improvement ideas:\n\nCountertops\n\nGreat countertops make a big difference to both a kitchen’s appearance and the cooking experience. Granite, Caesarstone and marble counters are always crowd favourites, but they do cost a fair bit and need to be installed by professionals. Timber and Formica are much more approachable and affordable for the DIY family, and can be just as attractive if they’re chosen and installed well.\n\nWhen selecting a Formica finish, Jacobs recommends avoiding dated options like faux granite or marble.\n\nModern wood grains and minimalist textures give the best results. A square edge profile rather than the traditional quarter-round also adds a more contemporary flavour.\n\nFor the more adventurous DIYer, there are also options like casting your own concrete countertops. Just keep in mind the general style of your home, and make sure your countertop choice enhances its surroundings.\n\nYour garage\n\nGarages may not seem like the most important part of a home, but Jacobs says homeowners can add a lot of value to their property by turning them into more functional spaces.\n\nGarages are often underutilised. They’re ideal spaces for adding extra storage - something that is very important to a lot of buyers, and can often accommodate a mini workbench or laundry area with a little planning.\n\nWhile adding a laundry corner to your garage would require a plumber, storage is an easy weekend DIY for the handyperson in your home.\n\nYou can buy ready-made cupboards and shelves from your local hardware store, but budget-conscious DIYers can also try second-hand websites to find old kitchen cabinets to mount along their garage walls.\n\nFor those with less available space, hanging storage may be a better option. Try pegboard walls with hooks for holding everything from bicycles to lawnmowers and secateurs.","articleBodyHtml":"<article>\n\n<p>Home improvements and makeovers range from painted walls to trendy feature tiles, lighting and backyard conversions.

Through \"Johanne 14,\" I aimed to showcase the resilience of our culture and its profound influence on our culinary traditions. It was an honour to represent Africa at the Gourmand Awards in China, competing in the Best Heritage Book in the World category. My roots trace back to Jouberton, a township in Klerksdorp, where I savoured the flavours of traditional Sotho cuisine prepared by my father, who worked in a mine kitchen.\n\nAfter completing my culinary studies at The Professional Cooking Academy in Rustenberg, I settled in Cape Town. In Cape Town, I faced the challenges of balancing multiple jobs to make ends meet while gaining valuable experience at various restaurants.\n\nMy journey led me to collaborate with the renowned chef Siba Mtongana during her time at Media24. I served as her assistant, contributing to recipe development and cooking for DRUM magazine. As time passed, I achieved the remarkable milestone of becoming South Africa's first black male food editor. During my tenure at DRUM, I won the prestigious Galliova Award for Best Food Writer of the Year for two consecutive years in 2015 and 2016.\n\nIn 2017, I furthered my culinary journey at Woolworths Taste magazine as the deputy food editor, exploring the chic and glossy side of gastronomy. My passion lies in showcasing the rich tapestry of African cuisine to the world. I am a pioneer on a mission to educate and celebrate the diverse flavors of African foods. It fills me with pride to have authored a book that pays tribute to the simple, traditional flavors of Mzansi, brimming with proudly South African dishes.\n\nDairy has long been a staple of South Africans with products like amasi, milk, yoghurt and cheese forming part of traditional and street food. And for good reason, too. Not only does it add taste, flavour and many important nutrients to your diet, but it is your bone-building partner throughout life. Consider this: one glass of amasi provides almost 50% of your daily requirement of Vitamin B12 - needed for a sharp brain and memory, 30% of your daily calcium needs to ensure strong bones and teeth, and 20% of your potassium needs to keep your heart healthy. Now keep scrolling for my Yoghurt Roosterkoek with BBQ Lamb... Mmmm!\n\nThis yoghurt roosterkoek comes ready-made with that extra batch of nutrients your body needs.\n\nLamb\n\n2kg lamb\n\n15ml (1tbsp) BBQ spice\n\n15ml (1tbsp) cumin\n\n15ml (1tbsp) paprika\n\n2,5ml (½ tsp) chilli powder\n\nhandful lamb fat\n\nSalad\n\nCheddar cheese, cubed\n\n2 tomatoes, chopped\n\n½ onion, diced\n\n1 green pepper, chopped\n\n3 Tbsp atchar\n\n1 tsp paprika\n\n½ cayenne pepper\n\n1 lemon juice or 3T vinegar\n\nsalt to taste\n\nRoosterkoek\n\n200ml warm water\n\n10g yeast\n\n20ml sugar\n\n750ml flour\n\n5ml salt\n\n30ml (2 tbsp) oil\n\n200ml double cream yoghurt\n\nMETHOD\n\n1. Roosterkoek: Mix water, yeast and sugar in a jug.\n2. In a large bowl add flour, salt and the yeast mixture. Mix by hand to make a ball. Knead on a floured surface or cutting board until soft dough forms.\n3. Place dough in a oiled bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Allow dough to double in size for 50 minutes.\n4. Divide dough into 12 balls and set aside for 20 minutes to double again.\n5. Place on griller and toast each side for 3 minutes turning for 10 minutes or until cooked inside.\n6. Lamb: Mix BBQ spice, cumin, paprika and chilli in a bowl. Add lamb to coat well.\n7. Grill lamb with pieces of fat to melt over the meat. Toss the meat and cutting thick pieces during cooking over medium heat for 10 minutes or until cooked.\n8. Salad: Mix all ingredients in a bowl.\n\nYoghurt contains good-quality protein, probiotics and all the other nutrients found in milk, such as calcium, vitamin B2, vitamin B12, potassium, magnesium and vitamin A.\nTo make the most of the nutrients and probiotics in your diet, enjoy it as a healthy snack with fruit, or mix with garlic and fresh herbs as salad dressing.\nFind out more about the benefits of dairy at rediscoverdairy.co.za.\n\nAdding amasi to a chicken renders it soft and tender, and adds that creamy, almost tangy taste to your dish. Amasi is a traditional ingredient that used to be made overnight in clay pots, and today it is still used for its unique flavour and goodness.\n\n1 whole chicken\n\n500ml amasi\n\nsalt and pepper\n\ngarlic\n\nBBQ spice\n\nMETHOD\n\n1. Mix all the ingredients for the amasi marinade in a very large ziplock bag, insert the chicken, and ensure the chicken is properly covered.\n2. Marinade overnight by placing the ziplock with chicken and other ingredients in the fridge.\n3. Grill over medium heat for 20 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through.\n\nOne glass of amasi contains 50% of your daily vitamin B12 requirement, 30% of your daily calcium requirement and 20% of your daily potassium requirement. It also gives you vitamin A and good-quality protein. Make it part of your daily diet by enjoying it as an anytime drink, pouring it over your pap, using it as a substitute for buttermilk or yoghurt when baking, or adding it to soups, pasta, smoothies, dips and sauces. It’s also an excellent recovery drink after exercise.\nFind out more at rediscoverdairy.co.za.\n\nTop Built with Shorthand","articleBodyHtml":"<article>\n\n<figure data-lazyload-container=\"true\" data-lazyload-trigger=\"true\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"\"></figure>\n\n<figure data-lazyload-container=\"true\" data-lazyload-trigger=\"true\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"\"></figure>\n\n<p>My journey into the world of food and storytelling began with the publication of my first cookbook, \"Johanne 14,\" in 2017.</p>\n\n<p>This book is a delightful fusion of traditional South African recipes with a contemporary twist, interwoven with nostalgic tales of days gone by.

of move day : Moving day is an exciting but often stressful experience. Whether you're relocating across town or to a new city, having a game plan in place can make all the difference.","articleBody":"Moving day is an exciting but often stressful experience. Whether you're relocating across town or to a new city, having a game plan in place can make all the difference.\n\nTo help make the day less stressful, RE/MAX of Southern Africa, shares their insights on how to make the process as smooth as possible…\n\nDO remember to update your address with banks, insurance providers, and any subscriptions. If possible, make sure the internet is set up at your new home before you arrive.\n\nDON’T forget to take measurements. Few things are more frustrating than realising your couch won’t fit through the front door after you’ve already lugged it up a steep driveway.\n\nDO pack an essentials box / bag that includes toiletries, important documents, chargers, basic kitchen supplies, and a change of clothes. Keep that box with you for easy access to necessities when you arrive at the new home.\n\nDON’T overload boxes. Keep boxes at a manageable weight to avoid injuries and prevent them from breaking. A well-packed, balanced load makes moving much safer and more efficient.\n\nDO a final walkthrough. Before leaving your old home, check every room, closet, and drawer to ensure nothing is left behind. This also allows you one final moment to say goodbye to your old home.\n\nDON’T leave packing until the last minute. Rushing to pack on moving day leads to disorganization and potential damage to your belongings. Give yourself enough time to sort, declutter, and properly pack your items.\n\nDO leverage your relationship with your real estate professional. A good real estate agent does more than just find you a home; they can often connect you with trusted moving services, storage solutions, and even handyman services to assist with settling in.\n\nMoving doesn’t have to be chaotic. By planning ahead, staying organised, and leveraging the expertise of a real estate professional, you can transition into your new home with ease. “A well-managed move sets the tone for a positive start in your new space,” concludes Adrian Goslett, Regional Director and CEO of RE/MAX of Southern Africa.\n\nMake a List\n\nWrite everything down; you will thank yourself later. Before you pack even one box, create a simple record-keeping system. Create a numbered list that specifically names the contents in each numbered box. You can designate a spiral-bound notebook for the job or generate the list on a computer. Make sure you put a number on every box you pack. When describing the box contents, be specific—\"A-D files\" is better than \"files\" and \"tulip dishes\" rather than \"kitchen.\" Never put the list down unless it's in your \"packing central\" location. This is where you store your labels, marking pens, box tape, and other packing supplies. In the midst of activity, you will be able to find what you need.\n\nHave Plenty of Supplies\n\nYou will need lots of boxes—​probably more boxes than you think and having enough boxes will make your life easier. If you buy your boxes from a moving company, you can always return unused boxes for a refund. Leave about 10 boxes set aside to use for last-minute items on moving day, such as bedding, clothing, and cleaning supplies.\n\nYou will need strong plastic packing tape to close up the boxes securely. Use unprinted newsprint paper (newspaper ink can stain some items), packing paper, or bubble wrap to wrap and cushion household goods. You will need a lot more supplies than you think, so get extra. Return any unused supplies after the truck is packed.\n\nColour Coordinate\n\nDesignate a colour for each room in the new home, such as yellow for the kitchen, orange for the dining room, and so on. Apply coloured stickers on the box near the box number. In your new home, put a matching sticker on the door to each room. The movers will know where to put everything when they arrive at the destination. It's also helpful to post a big sign on the wall in the room where you want boxes stacked, such as \"Boxes here please\" to keep them out of furniture and traffic areas.\n\nKeep Things Together\n\nInsist on keeping things together when you or the movers are packing boxes. Keep bookends with books, light bulbs with lamps, and extension cords with appliances. Small, loose parts can be attached to the item they belong to with tape or placed in small envelopes. Keep picture hooks with pictures, shelf brackets with the bookcase, and a special wrench and bolts with the wall unit. Keep larger corresponding items (such as a cable TV cord) in resealable bags, and tape these to the underside or back of the item.\n\nAs a backup, have a \"Parts Box\" open on the kitchen counter and fill it with cables, cords, parts, pieces, brackets, or nails that are removed from any items of furniture. Keep this box with you, or mark it well with a rainbow of colored stickers so it can be easily located on move-in day.\n\nPack Ahead and Use Your Containers\n\nAnything you can pack ahead will save you time on moving day. If it's summer, get your winter clothes out of the way. You do not need multiple TVs around your house for the last few days there. Box up your shampoo and extra toothpaste and use items out of a travel cosmetic case for the last week or two.

Whether you're relocating across town or to a new city, having a game plan in place can make all the difference.</p>\n\n<p>To help make the day less stressful, RE/MAX of Southern Africa, shares their insights on how to make the process as smooth as possible…</p>\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://images.prop24.com/354194439\"></figure>\n\n<p><strong>DO</strong> remember to update your address with banks, insurance providers, and any subscriptions. If possible, make sure the internet is set up at your new home before you arrive.</p>\n\n<p><strong>DON’T</strong> forget to take measurements. Few things are more frustrating than realising your couch won’t fit through the front door after you’ve already lugged it up a steep driveway.</p>\n\n<p><strong>DO </strong>pack an essentials box / bag that includes toiletries, important documents, chargers, basic kitchen supplies, and a change of clothes. Keep that box with you for easy access to necessities when you arrive at the new home.</p>\n\n<p><strong>DON’T </strong>overload boxes. Keep boxes at a manageable weight to avoid injuries and prevent them from breaking. A well-packed, balanced load makes moving much safer and more efficient.</p>\n\n<p><strong>DO </strong>a final walkthrough. Before leaving your old home, check every room, closet, and drawer to ensure nothing is left behind. This also allows you one final moment to say goodbye to your old home.</p>\n\n<p><strong>DON’T</strong> leave packing until the last minute. Rushing to pack on moving day leads to disorganization and potential damage to your belongings. Give yourself enough time to sort, declutter, and properly pack your items.</p>\n\n<p><strong>DO </strong>leverage your relationship with your real estate professional. A good real <a href=\"https://www.property24.com/estate-agents/search\" title=\"Find an Estate Agent on Property24, South Africa’s leading Property Website\">estate agent</a> does more than just find you a home; they can often connect you with trusted moving services, storage solutions, and even handyman services to assist with settling in.</p>\n\n<p>Moving doesn’t have to be chaotic. By planning ahead, staying organised, and leveraging the expertise of a real estate professional, you can transition into your new home with ease. “A well-managed move sets the tone for a positive start in your new space,” concludes Adrian Goslett, Regional Director and CEO of <a href=\"https://www.property24.com/estate-agents/re-max-of-south-africa/g22\">RE/MAX of Southern Africa</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Make a List</strong></p>\n\n<p>Write everything down; you will thank yourself later. Before you pack even one box, create a simple record-keeping system. Create a numbered list that specifically names the contents in each numbered box. You can designate a spiral-bound notebook for the job or generate the list on a computer. Make sure you put a number on <em>every</em> box you pack. When describing the box contents, be specific—\"A-D files\" is better than \"files\" and \"tulip dishes\" rather than \"kitchen.\" Never put the list down unless it's in your \"packing central<em>\"</em> location. This is where you store your labels, marking pens, box tape, and other packing supplies. In the midst of activity, you will be able to find what you need.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Have Plenty of Supplies</strong></p>\n\n<p>You will need lots of boxes—​probably more boxes than you think and having enough boxes will make your life easier. If you buy your boxes from a moving company, you can always return unused boxes for a refund. Leave about 10 boxes set aside to use for last-minute items on moving day, such as bedding, clothing, and cleaning supplies.</p>\n\n<p>You will need strong plastic packing tape to close up the boxes securely. Use unprinted newsprint paper (newspaper ink can stain some items), packing paper, or bubble wrap to wrap and cushion household goods. You will need a lot more supplies than you think, so get extra. Return any unused supplies after the truck is packed.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Colour Coordinate</strong></p>\n\n<p>Designate a colour for each room in the new home, such as yellow for the kitchen, orange for the dining room, and so on. Apply coloured stickers on the box near the box number. In your new home, put a matching sticker on the door to each room. The movers will know where to put everything when they arrive at the destination. It's also helpful to post a big sign on the wall in the room where you want boxes stacked, such as \"Boxes here please\" to keep them out of furniture and traffic areas.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Keep Things Together</strong></p>\n\n<p>Insist on keeping things together when you or the movers are packing boxes. Keep bookends with books, light bulbs with lamps, and extension cords with appliances. Small, loose parts can be attached to the item they belong to with tape or placed in small envelopes. Keep picture hooks with pictures, shelf brackets with the bookcase, and a special wrench and bolts with the wall unit. Keep larger corresponding items (such as a cable TV cord) in resealable bags, and tape these to the underside or back of the item.</p>\n\n<p>As a backup, have a \"Parts Box\" open on the kitchen counter and fill it with cables, cords, parts, pieces, brackets, or nails that are removed from any items of furniture. Keep this box with you, or mark it well with a rainbow of colored stickers so it can be easily located on move-in day.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pack Ahead and Use Your Containers</strong></p>\n\n<p>Anything you can pack ahead will save you time on moving day. If it's summer, get your winter clothes out of the way. You do not need multiple TVs around your house for the last few days there. Box up your shampoo and extra toothpaste and use items out of a travel cosmetic case for the last week or two. Pare down cooking utensils and food supplies to the bare essentials.</p>\n\n<p>Wastebaskets can also be packed (put things in them) while you switch to using plastic grocery bags for trash collection.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Consolidate Cleaning Supplies</strong></p>\n\n<p>If you must clean your old place after moving out, put together a kit of basic cleaning supplies and rags.

With the right approach—and the guidance of an experienced real estate agent—you can turn a lowball offer into a successful sale.\n\n“A low offer does not have to be a dealbreaker,” says Adrian Goslett, Regional Director and CEO of RE/MAX of Southern Africa. “Buyers may simply be testing the waters, so it’s important to remain open to negotiation rather than rejecting an offer outright.”\n\nLowball offers—those significantly below market value—are common, “especially in a buyer’s market like we are currently in across many most markets in SA,” Goslett notes. While these offers can feel discouraging, sellers should avoid taking them personally. Instead, he encourages sellers to consider why the buyer may be offering less. “It could be due to a perception of market conditions, the property’s condition, or simply a negotiating tactic,” he states.\n\n“A professional agent knows how to gauge the seriousness of a buyer and can negotiate on your behalf to secure a better offer. They understand market trends, can justify your asking price with data, and ultimately ensure you get the best possible deal,” explains Goslett.\n\nWhen presented with a lowball offer, RE/MAX of Southern Africa shares the following tips for how best to proceed next:\n\nStay Calm and Assess – Consider the offer objectively. Ask your agent how the offer compares to local market conditions, recent sales, and your home’s value before responding.\nCounteroffer Strategically – Rather than outright rejecting the offer, work with your agent to present a reasonable counteroffer.\nKnow When to Walk Away – If an offer is unreasonably low and the buyer is unwilling to budge, or if the market is hot and another offer is sure to come your way soon, your agent can guide you on whether it’s best to move on and wait for a better opportunity.\n\n“Negotiation is a process. Sometimes, a low offer is just the starting point for a fair deal. An agent can help bridge the gap between buyer and seller expectations and can let you know when it’s best to move on. If you want to sell your home for the best possible price, partnering with an experienced real estate professional truly is your best move,” says Goslett.\n\nAccording to the Seeff Property Group, (The role of a real estate agent : What you need to know) agents do not only sell or rent property on behalf of their clients, but also have their ear to the ground in terms of what current property values are, how much properties might sell for, and what is happening in the property market.\n\nAlways meet the agents in person before appointing them:\n\nThis will give you a chance to ask questions and assess the agents. Check how long they have operated in the area. Each area is different and local expertise is a vital point of advantage for any seller.\n\nLook for a successful sales track record:\n\nAsk for a list of their recent sales in the area, how long it took to sell, and the prices achieved. A strong sales record is an important indicator of the likelihood of success and that the agent could find the right buyer for the property.\n\nA strong brand and network is another advantage:\n\nAn established brand will have a strong online presence for maximum exposure of your property backed by the latest technology and marketing and sales methodologies. They will use best practice to market and sell your property.\n\nLook for someone who will assist every step of the way:\n\nSelling a property is a complex process with many legalities to be taken care of. A good agent will explain the process and guide the seller to ensure they have all the necessary documents and maintenance done for an efficient selling process.\n\nGet the price right\n\nSetting yourself up for selling success has a great deal to do with finding the pricing sweet spot. “Ultimately, prevailing market conditions determine what a property sells at. Of course that is influenced by the state of the property, the location and various other factors,” Viljoen says.\n\nHe adds that pricing it too low(in relation to similar properties in the area) tends to make buyers think there is something wrong with the property, while overpricing simply means that it won’t draw buyers. “Remember, buyers have access to various online tools and portals so they know exactly what similar properties are priced at,” Viljoen explains.\n\nA property professional (see above!) is a great resource in this regard, and can work with a seller to establish the best, most accurate asking price for a property.\n\nUnderstand the cost of selling\n\nIf there’s one thing to take from Viljoen’s advice it is to make very sure that, as the seller, you understand the various costs associated with selling a property. From bond cancellation costs to compliance certificates and agent commission, just because you’re the seller doesn’t mean you won’t incur costs.\n\nPut your best foot forward\n\nLastly but as importantly, make sure that when a potential buyer views your property, they see it in the best light.\n\nPut some effort into staging your home but ensuring it is clean, light and clutter-free at the very least. “The old adage about not getting a second chance to make a first impression is particularly true when it comes to potential buyers viewing properties,” Viljoen concludes.","articleBodyHtml":"<article>\n\n<p>Receiving an offer well below your asking price can be frustrating for any home seller but it is important to remember that negotiating is all part of the process.

The introduction of the Companies Act, 2008 was a significant shift, promoting business rescue as a preferred alternative to liquidation.\n\nHowever, courts have increasingly encountered cases where business rescue applications are used as a delay tactic, raising concerns about abuse.\n\nThis article examines the key legal principles and implications from the recent reportable judgment in Globustarr Trading Co L.L.C. v Mayana Properties (Pty) Ltd (case no. 2021-59389) handed down on 18 March 2025. The Johannesburg High Court addressed abusive business rescue applications used to obstruct liquidation and clarified the interpretation of \"liquidation proceedings\" under section 131(6) of the 2008 Act.\n\nBackground to the case\n\nIn December 2021, the applicant creditor sought a final winding-up order against the respondent under section 346 of the Companies Act 1973 (1973 Act), as the respondent was insolvent and unable to pay its debts.\n\nHowever, multiple delays stalled the liquidation hearing. The court criticised one such delay – the respondent's exceptionally late filing of its answering affidavit – as a \"cynically designed to delay\" adjudication.\n\nJust days before the liquidation hearing, the respondent filed an interlocutory adjournment application, attaching a separate business rescue application. It argued that this should suspend liquidation proceedings under either:\n\nSection 347 of the 1973 Act, or\n\nSection 131(6) of the 2008 Act.\n\nThe court considered two key statutory provisions\n\nSection 347(1) of the 1973 Act provides that:\n\nThe court may grant or dismiss any application under section 346, or adjourn the hearing thereof, conditionally or unconditionally, or make any interim order or any other order it may deem just…\n\nSection 131(6) of the 2008 Act states:\n\nIf liquidation proceedings have already been commenced by or against the company at the time an application is made in terms of subsection (1), the application will suspend those liquidation proceedings until: (a) the court has adjudicated upon the application; or (b) the business rescue proceedings end, if the court makes the order applied for.\n\nThe court had to determine whether the business rescue application was an abuse of process and, if so, whether the liquidation proceedings could continue despite section 131(6) of the 2008 Act.\n\nBusiness rescue as an abuse of process\n\nThe court relied on the recent Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) judgement in PFC Properties (Pty) Ltd v Commissioner, South African Revenue Service and Others 2024 (1) SA 400 (SCA) (PFC Properties).\n\nIn this case, the SCA held that if a party uses the business rescue process for an ulterior purpose, such as to thwart winding-up proceedings, this undermines the rule of law, and so a court has the authority to non-suit that party. The SCA further clarified:\n\n[T]he business rescue application was not 'made', as envisaged in section 131(6); the moratorium did not come into operation and did not suspend the winding-up proceedings. That being so, there was no impediment to the winding-up proceedings.\n\nThe High Court, after examining the substance (or lack thereof) of the business rescue application, and the respondent’s previous conduct, held that:\n\n(a) there is no defence to the liquidation application; (b) the business rescue application was brought cynically at such a time so as to have the maximum disruptive effect on the adjudication of the liquidation application; and (c) there is no merit in the business rescue application. The business rescue application is therefore an abuse, brought in the face of a sound liquidation application.\n\nHaving found that the business rescue application was an abuse, the court confirmed that section 131(6) did not apply and dismissed the adjournment application.\n\nThe interpretation of liquidation proceedings in section 131(6)\n\nThe court also clarified long-standing ambiguity regarding the meaning of 'liquidation proceedings' in section 131(6) of the 2008 Act. By referencing the PFC Properties, the court confirmed that 'liquidation proceedings' include both the post-order winding-up process and the liquidation application itself.\n\nThe court reasoned that when a business rescue application is found to be an abuse of process, it is deemed not to have been \"made\" under section 131(6). As a result, the liquidation application remains unaffected and may proceed. The court specifically held that:\n\nIf section 131(6) did not apply to a liquidation application, then the question as to whether an abusive application for business rescue suspends a liquidation application does not arise. In my view, PFC Properties is therefore binding authority for the proposition that 'liquidation proceedings' in section 131(6) includes an application for liquidation.\n\nThis clarification is significant because it confirms that a bona fide business rescue application suspends a pending liquidation application under section 131(6). Litigants and courts must now carefully assess whether a business rescue application is being used for an ulterior purpose to delay a bona fide liquidation application.\n\nThe judgment sends a clear message to litigants seeking to misuse business rescue applications as a delay tactic. It reinforces the principle that courts will scrutinise the intent behind the business rescue applications and reject those brought in bad faith.\n\nTo deter future abuse, the court ordered de bonis propriis costs against the applicant in the business rescue application, meaning that the individual responsible for the application, not just the company, was personally liable for legal costs.\n\nThe Globustarr case judgment strengthens the integrity of business rescue proceedings while ensuring they are not exploited to stall liquidation. It clarifies the interpretation of section 131(6) and confirms that courts have the power to reject abusive business rescue applications.\n\nFor businesses, creditors, and legal practitioners, this ruling sets a clear precedent and reinforces the court’s role in safeguarding South Africa’s insolvency framework.\n\nJulian Jones is a partner; Caellyn Eedes a senior associate and Liso Potwana a candidate attorney at Webber Wentzel.","articleBodyHtml":"<article>\n\n<p><em><strong>Julian Jones, Caellyn Eedes and Liso Potwana</strong> examine a recent case that saw the Johannesburg High Court address abusive business rescue applications.</em></p>\n\n<ul><li><strong>For more financial news, go to the </strong><a href=\"https://www.news24.com/fin24\"><strong>News24 Business front page</strong></a><strong>.</strong></li></ul>\n\n<p>Ulterior motives disguised as good faith business rescue proceedings have become a growing concern in South African insolvency law.

This is an edited and abridged version of the remarks made by Professor Tinyiko Maluleke, deputy chair of the NPC, at the conference.\n\nI am an unmitigated sucker for poetry and a hopeless addict of such stunning book opening lines such as those of Sol Plaatje's Native Life in South Africa and Es'kia Mphahlele's Down Second Avenue.\n\nIn a line or two, they captured the essence of the national tragedy of their times. Service delivery is becoming a crisis of our times.\n\nHow I wish I had such powers of diction to capture the impact and the meaning of the service delivery problems in our country at this time. How I wish I had the turn of phrase with which to encourage my fellow South Africans to \"rage, rage against the dying of the light\" of service delivery a la Dylan Thomas.\n\nDuring his recent pre-G20 reconnaissance visit to the Gauteng province, President Cyril Ramaphosa confirmed that the country is in the midst of a service delivery crisis.\n\nService delivery: The trouble with South Africa\n\nIn the city of Lagos in the early 1980s, Chinua Achebe noticed that everywhere he went, most conversations started with the phrase \"the trouble with Nigeria is…\". So, Achebe decided to write a book titled: The Trouble with Nigeria. Thus begins the book:\n\nThe trouble with Nigeria is simply and squarely a failure of leadership. … The Nigerian problem is the unwillingness or inability of its leaders to rise to the responsibility, to the challenge of personal example which is the hallmark of true leadership.\n\nIn relation to service delivery, South Africa may have reached a similar stage as was the Nigeria of the early 1980s. An Achebian take on the trouble with South Africa at this time, might read like this:\n\nThe trouble with South Africa is simply and squarely a failure of service delivery. There is nothing basically wrong with the South African character. There is nothing wrong with South African land or climate or water or air or anything else. The South African problem is the unwillingness or inability of its leaders to rise to the responsibility of service delivery, which is the hallmark of true leadership at this point in our history.\n\nThe most common phrase on the lips of South Africans at this time and, perhaps, over most of the past thirty years, is the phrase, \"service delivery\".\n\nA boy called Service Delivery\n\nNothing illustrates the ubiquity of the phrase \"service delivery\" in South African life better than the story of a boy named Service Delivery.\n\nIn the short and nondescript street of Letsogo in Zone 8, Meadowlands, Soweto, where I grew up, there is a boy called Service Delivery Mthimkhulu. During the morning of Saturday 9 June 2012, Service Delivery was almost not born. The week ending 10 June 2012 was the culmination of a sustained period of erratic service delivery in Meadowlands – intermittent water supply, frequent electricity cuts, sporadic waste removal, and unresponsive police.\n\nAs his heavily pregnant mother was being rushed to hospital, tyre-burning and toyi-toying service-delivery protesters had blocked the main road. Only the use of detours and shortcuts between Meadowlands and Diepkloof prevented Service Delivery from being born en route to Baragwanath Hospital. In light of the service delivery incidents and accidents of the day and the times, it must have seemed evident to the Mthimkhulus, once the baby was delivered, that the only fitting name for the newborn was Service Delivery.\n\nTo this day, his parents believe that the trauma of being born during such a turbulent time may explain why Service Delivery suffers both from sporadic bouts of epilepsy and fits of violent behaviour. He is in danger of slipping into the NEET category of young people - not in education, employment or training.\n\nA Deeply Felt Reality\n\nIndeed, \"service delivery\" may not be that elegant a phrase. It is too blunt, too mundane, too basic a phrase, with nothing exotic, poetic, or philosophical about it. It describes a deeply felt reality, which has been the national rallying cry for the past 20 years. It is the most accessible shorthand for the expression of the hopes and the needs of South Africans. The problems and promises of the seven national elections held since democracy all revolved around service delivery. By the May 2024 elections, service delivery was still a potent phrase, but by then, more as a problem than a promise.\n\nOne of the most striking and repeated features of the second half of our 30-year democracy has been the phenomenon of \"service delivery protests\" – protests about the most basic services: jobs, houses, water and sanitation, electricity, roads, transport, and human dignity.\n\nREAD | World Bank and SA have R55bn plan to 'reverse the collapse' in major cities\n\nI am yet to see a service delivery protest because of the absence of wi-fi. And that is not to say Wi-Fi, Facebook and WhatsApp have not become \"human rights\" in the 21st century. It is because South African service delivery protests are about things more basic.\n\nArmed with the National Development Plan (NDP) Vision 2030, the National Planning Commission (NPC) has been trying to understand the root causes of poor service delivery. Note has been taken of the capacity and the maintenance issues within metros, municipalities and provinces.\n\nSimilarly, note has been taken of the poor planning coordination and the incoherence between the local, provincial, and national spheres of government. The disjuncture between the promises of the NDP and our Bill of Rights is jarring. The NPC has been hard at work trying to understand the causes, effects, scale, impact of poor service delivery, as well as how to return the country to the course laid out by the NDP.\n\nSouth Africans have what it takes to overcome the problems of service delivery. As a nation, we know where we ought to be going as far as service delivery is concerned. We have clear national objectives and targets. We know what needs to be done. However, we also need to understand why and how we have gone off course and why we have achieved less than what we set out to do in the first place.\n\nService Delivery is sick\n\nThe Meadowlands lad called Service Delivery Mthimkhulu is growing into adolescence now. Recently, when I checked on the 13-year-old, I discovered that Service Delivery is sick – sick in the soul and sick in the body.\n\nThis brings me to the Miriam Makeba song about a sick child. Once when faced with a sick child in the house, she and her friend Dudu went looking for a sangoma.\n\nSahamba noDudu (off we went with Dudu)\n\nSayofun’isangoma (searching for a Sangoma)\n\nSafik’isangoma sathi umtwana u ya gula (the Sangoma arrived and said the child is ill)\n\nUMtwana uyagula (the child is ill?)\n\nUmMtwana uyagula (the child is ill!)\n\nUphethwe yini naa? (What illness is troubling the child?)\n\nThe sangoma merely repeated what Miriam and Dudu already knew, asking the same questions as Miriam and Dudu had asked but providing no further analysis or cogent answers. In desperation, but without shedding any light on the problem, the sangoma eventually found someone to blame. \"There is a witch in this house!\" (umthakathi usendlini!) shouted the sangoma.\n\nThe national dialogue on the state of service delivery intended to do more than merely regurgitate what is known. The dialogue intended to do more than find someone to blame. At the dialogue, the root causes were probed, and frameworks for lasting solutions were sought. I am glad to confirm that the dialogue achieved all these and more.\n\nBut alas! Service Delivery is sick in Soweto and elsewhere. We must probe beyond the symptoms. We dare not let Service Delivery down.\n\nService delivery is the single most important conversation in South Africa today, apart from Donald Trump.\n\n- Prof Tinyiko Maluleke is d eputy chairperson of the National Planning Commission.\n\nDisclaimer: News24 encourages freedom of speech and the expression of diverse views.

How I wish I had the turn of phrase with which to encourage my fellow South Africans to \"rage, rage against the dying of the light\" of service delivery <em>a la</em> Dylan Thomas.</p>\n\n<p>During his recent pre-G20 reconnaissance visit to the Gauteng province, President Cyril Ramaphosa confirmed that the country is in the midst of a service delivery crisis.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Service delivery: The trouble with South Africa</strong></p>\n\n<p>In the city of Lagos in the early 1980s, Chinua Achebe noticed that everywhere he went, most conversations started with the phrase \"the trouble with Nigeria is…\". So, Achebe decided to write a book titled: <em>The Trouble with Nigeria. </em>Thus begins the book:</p>\n\n<blockquote>The trouble with Nigeria is simply and squarely a failure of leadership. … The Nigerian problem is the unwillingness or inability of its leaders to rise to the responsibility, to the challenge of personal example which is the hallmark of true leadership.</blockquote>\n\n<p>In relation to service delivery, South Africa may have reached a similar stage as was the Nigeria of the early 1980s. An <em>Achebian</em> take on the trouble with South Africa at this time, might read like this:</p>\n\n<p>The trouble with South Africa is simply and squarely a failure of service delivery. There is nothing basically wrong with the South African character. There is nothing wrong with South African land or climate or water or air or anything else. The South African problem is the unwillingness or inability of its leaders to rise to the responsibility of service delivery, which is the hallmark of true leadership at this point in our history.</p>\n\n<p>The most common phrase on the lips of South Africans at this time and, perhaps, over most of the past thirty years, is the phrase, \"service delivery\".</p>\n\n<p><strong>A boy called Service Delivery</strong></p>\n\n<p>Nothing illustrates the ubiquity of the phrase \"service delivery\" in South African life better than the story of a boy named Service Delivery.</p>\n\n<p>In the short and nondescript street of Letsogo in Zone 8, Meadowlands, Soweto, where I grew up, there is a boy called Service Delivery Mthimkhulu. During the morning of Saturday 9 June 2012, Service Delivery was almost not born. The week ending 10 June 2012 was the culmination of a sustained period of erratic service delivery in Meadowlands – intermittent water supply, frequent electricity cuts, sporadic waste removal, and unresponsive police.</p>\n\n<p>As his heavily pregnant mother was being rushed to hospital, tyre-burning and toyi-toying service-delivery protesters had blocked the main road. Only the use of detours and shortcuts between Meadowlands and Diepkloof prevented Service Delivery from being born en route to Baragwanath Hospital. In light of the service delivery incidents and accidents of the day and the times, it must have seemed evident to the Mthimkhulus, once the baby was delivered, that the only fitting name for the newborn was Service Delivery.</p>\n\n<p>To this day, his parents believe that the trauma of being born during such a turbulent time may explain why Service Delivery suffers both from sporadic bouts of epilepsy and fits of violent behaviour. He is in danger of slipping into the NEET category of young people - not in education, employment or training.</p>\n\n<p><strong>A Deeply Felt Reality</strong></p>\n\n<p>Indeed, \"service delivery\" may not be that elegant a phrase. It is too blunt, too mundane, too basic a phrase, with nothing exotic, poetic, or philosophical about it. It describes a deeply felt reality, which has been the national rallying cry for the past 20 years. It is the most accessible shorthand for the expression of the hopes and the needs of South Africans. The problems and promises of the seven national elections held since democracy all revolved around service delivery. By the May 2024 elections, service delivery was still a potent phrase, but by then, more as a problem than a promise.</p>\n\n<p>One of the most striking and repeated features of the second half of our 30-year democracy has been the phenomenon of \"service delivery protests\" – protests about the most basic services: jobs, houses, water and sanitation, electricity, roads, transport, and human dignity.</p>\n\n<p><strong>READ | </strong><a href=\"https://www.news24.com/fin24/economy/world-bank-and-sa-have-r55bn-plan-to-reverse-the-collapse-in-major-cities-20250327\"><strong>World Bank and SA have R55bn plan to 'reverse the collapse' in major cities</strong></a></p>\n\n<p>I am yet to see a service delivery protest because of the absence of wi-fi. And that is not to say Wi-Fi, Facebook and WhatsApp have not become \"human rights\" in the 21st century. It is because South African service delivery protests are about things more basic.</p>\n\n<p>Armed with the National Development Plan (NDP) Vision 2030, the National Planning Commission (NPC) has been trying to understand the root causes of poor service delivery. Note has been taken of the capacity and the maintenance issues within metros, municipalities and provinces.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, note has been taken of the poor planning coordination and the incoherence between the local, provincial, and national spheres of government.  The disjuncture between the promises of the NDP and our Bill of Rights is jarring. The NPC has been hard at work trying to understand the causes, effects, scale, impact of poor service delivery, as well as how to return the country to the course laid out by the NDP.</p>\n\n<p>South Africans have what it takes to overcome the problems of service delivery. As a nation, we know where we ought to be going as far as service delivery is concerned. We have clear national objectives and targets. We know what needs to be done. However, we also need to understand why and how we have gone off course and why we have achieved less than what we set out to do in the first place.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Service Delivery is sick</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Meadowlands lad called Service Delivery Mthimkhulu is growing into adolescence now. Recently, when I checked on the 13-year-old, I discovered that Service Delivery is sick – sick in the soul and sick in the body.</p>\n\n<p>This brings me to the Miriam Makeba song about a sick child. Once when faced with a sick child in the house, she and her friend Dudu went looking for a sangoma.</p>\n\n<p><em>Sahamba noDudu</em> (off we went with Dudu)</p>\n\n<p><em>Sayofun’isangoma</em> (searching for a<em> Sangoma</em>)</p>\n\n<p><em>Safik’isangoma</em> sathi umtwana u ya gula (the <em>Sangoma</em> arrived and said the child is ill)</p>\n\n<p><em>UMtwana uyagula</em> (the child is ill?)</p>\n\n<p><em>UmMtwana uyagula</em> (the child is ill!)</p>\n\n<p><em>Uphethwe yini naa?</em> (What illness is troubling the child?)</p>\n\n<p>The sangoma merely repeated what Miriam and Dudu already knew, asking the same questions as Miriam and Dudu had asked but providing no further analysis or cogent answers. In desperation, but without shedding any light on the problem, the sangoma eventually found someone to blame. \"There is a witch in this house!\" (<em>umthakathi</em> usendlini!) shouted the sangoma.</p>\n\n<p>The national dialogue on the state of service delivery intended to do more than merely regurgitate what is known. The dialogue intended to do more than find someone to blame. At the dialogue, the root causes were probed, and frameworks for lasting solutions were sought. I am glad to confirm that the dialogue achieved all these and more.</p>\n\n<p>But alas! Service Delivery is sick in Soweto and elsewhere. We must probe beyond the symptoms. We dare not let Service Delivery down.</p>\n\n<p>Service delivery is the single most important conversation in South Africa today, apart from Donald Trump.</p>\n\n<p><em>- Prof Tinyiko Maluleke is d</em><em>eputy chairperson of the National Planning Commission.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> News24 encourages freedom of speech and the expression of diverse views.

times to come and aims to provoke a feeling of euphoria.\n\n“I work primarily with the captured image.\n\n“Altered, reimagined and reinterpreted.
