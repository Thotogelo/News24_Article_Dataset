"","Embrace the possibility of change and the potential it holds for new adventures and achievements. Your next career opportunity might just be around the corner!

Navigating the professional landscape can be challenging, and knowing when it’s time to leave your current job is a crucial skill for career growth and personal satisfaction. If you’re feeling restless or unfulfilled, it might be a sign that your current role no longer aligns with your goals or values. Here’s how to recognise the tell-tale signs that it’s time to make your next career move.

1. You Dread Going to Work

If the thought of going to work fills you with anxiety or dread, it’s a clear signal that something isn’t right. While everyone has off days, consistent feelings of unhappiness or stress are red flags. This emotional drain can significantly impact your overall well-being and productivity.

Action Step: Reflect on what specifically causes these feelings. Is it the workload, the company culture, or a lack of passion for the job itself? Understanding the root cause can help you decide your next steps.

2. Lack of Growth Opportunities

In a fulfilling career, there should always be room for growth and development. If you find that there are no opportunities for advancement or learning new skills, you might feel stuck and uninspired.

Action Step: Have a conversation with your manager about your career aspirations. If there’s no clear path for growth, it might be time to explore new opportunities where your skills and ambitions are valued.

3. Your Values No Longer Align

As you progress in your career, your personal values and goals may evolve. If you find that your company’s mission, culture, or ethical practices no longer align with your own, it can lead to a sense of disconnection and dissatisfaction.

Action Step: Re-evaluate your personal and professional values. Seek out companies that align more closely with your beliefs and where you can feel more integrated and purposeful.

4. You’re Underappreciated or Overworked

Feeling undervalued, consistently overworked, or underpaid are common reasons people decide to move on. When your efforts are not recognised or rewarded, it can lead to burnout and resentment.

Action Step: Assess your current workload and compensation. Have an open discussion with your manager about your concerns and seek recognition or rewards that match your contributions. If the response is unsatisfactory, consider looking for a more appreciative work environment.

5. Toxic Work Environment

A toxic work environment can have a detrimental effect on your mental and physical health. Signs include poor communication, constant negativity, lack of support, and workplace bullying.

Action Step: Document specific instances of toxic behaviour and consider speaking with HR or a trusted advisor within the company. If the environment does not improve, prioritising your health and well-being by seeking a healthier workplace is crucial.

6. You’re No Longer Learning

If you’re not learning anything new and your daily tasks feel monotonous, it could indicate that you’ve outgrown your current role. Continuous learning and challenges are essential for professional satisfaction and growth.

Action Step: Identify areas where you’d like to grow and seek out new projects or responsibilities within your current role. If opportunities are limited, it may be time to find a position that offers more growth potential.

7. Your Gut Tells You It’s Time

Sometimes, your intuition is the best guide. If you have a persistent feeling that it’s time to move on, it’s worth listening to that inner voice.

Action Step: Trust your instincts and start exploring new opportunities. Networking, updating your resume, and researching companies can provide new perspectives and options for your career.

Deciding to leave a job is never easy, but recognising these signs can help you make a more informed and confident decision. Prioritise your happiness, growth, and well-being by seeking opportunities that align with your evolving career goals and personal values. Remember, the right move can lead to a more fulfilling and prosperous career path.

<p><strong>Action
Step:</strong> Assess
your current workload and compensation. Have an open discussion with your
manager about your concerns and seek recognition or rewards that match your
contributions. If the response is unsatisfactory, consider looking for a more
appreciative work environment.</p>

<p><strong>5.
Toxic Work Environment</strong></p>

<p>A toxic
work environment can have a detrimental effect on your mental and physical
health. Signs include poor communication, constant negativity, lack of support,
and workplace bullying.</p>

<p><strong>Action
Step</strong>: Document
specific instances of toxic behaviour and consider speaking with HR or a
trusted advisor within the company. If the environment does not improve,
prioritising your health and well-being by seeking a healthier workplace is
crucial.</p>

<p><strong>6.
You’re No Longer Learning</strong></p>

<p>If
you’re not learning anything new and your daily tasks feel monotonous, it could
indicate that you’ve outgrown your current role. Continuous learning and
challenges are essential for professional satisfaction and growth.</p>

<p><strong>Action
Step</strong>: Identify
areas where you’d like to grow and seek out new projects or responsibilities
within your current role. If opportunities are limited, it may be time to find
a position that offers more growth potential.</p>

<p><strong>7.
Your Gut Tells You It’s Time</strong></p>

<p>Sometimes,
your intuition is the best guide. If you have a persistent feeling that it’s
time to move on, it’s worth listening to that inner voice.</p>

<p><strong>Action
Step:</strong> Trust
your instincts and start exploring new opportunities. Networking, updating your
resume, and researching companies can provide new perspectives and options for
your career.</p>

<p>Deciding
to leave a job is never easy, but recognising these signs can help you make a
more informed and confident decision. Prioritise your happiness, growth, and
well-being by seeking opportunities that align with your evolving career goals
and personal values. Remember, the right move can lead to a more fulfilling and
prosperous career path.</p>

<p>Embrace
the possibility of change and the potential it holds for new adventures and
achievements. Your next career opportunity might just be around the corner!</p>

"","1. The Upswing of Blue-Collar Work

Blue-collar jobs, which typically involve manual labour in trades such as construction, manufacturing, or maintenance, have historically been undervalued compared to white-collar jobs. However, the perception is shifting, especially as the economy witnesses a growing demand for skilled workers in these sectors. South Africa, with its ongoing infrastructure projects and a burgeoning manufacturing sector, presents numerous opportunities for blue-collar workers.

2. Earning Potential and Expected Salaries

The earning potential for blue-collar workers in South Africa can be quite surprising, particularly for those with specialised skills and years of experience. Let's explore some of these professions:

Electricians

A licensed electrician in South Africa can earn between R250,000 to R450,000 annually. Those who own their businesses or work as independent contractors can potentially earn even more. With a constant need for electrical maintenance, repairs, and installations in residential, commercial, and industrial settings, electricians' skills are always in demand.

Plumbers

Plumbers are another group of professionals whose skills are consistently required. They can earn an average salary of R200,000 to R400,000 annually. Plumbers with a specialisation, such as gas fitting or pipe laying, can command higher salaries. Like electricians, plumbers who own their own businesses or work independently can increase their earnings significantly.

Welders

Welding is a critical skill in many sectors, including construction, manufacturing, and shipbuilding. A skilled welder in South Africa can expect to earn between R150,000 and R350,000 per year. Highly experienced welders or those with specialist welding skills can earn even more.

Construction Managers

Construction is a booming industry in South Africa, and experienced construction managers are highly sought after. A construction manager can earn anywhere from R300,000 to R700,000 per year, depending on the complexity of the projects they oversee.

3. The Future of Blue-Collar Work in South Africa

The future of blue-collar work in South Africa looks promising. With the country's ongoing development and a move towards industrialisation, skilled blue-collar workers will continue to be in high demand.

Moreover, the South African government's commitment to infrastructure development and vocational training is likely to further boost opportunities in blue-collar sectors. Various initiatives aim to provide young South Africans with vocational training to fill these roles, ensuring a steady supply of skilled workers for these high-paying blue-collar jobs.

The surprising earning potential of blue-collar work in South Africa is a testament to the changing dynamics of the job market. The perception that only white-collar jobs offer attractive salaries is being challenged. Blue-collar professions, requiring skill, dedication, and often a good deal of physical labour, are offering competitive salaries and attractive career opportunities. This shift not only provides an avenue for financial stability for a wider range of workers but also helps to foster a more diverse and resilient economy.","<article>

Connie Chiume: 45 years in showbiz and still going strong

“During those days, you wouldn’t dare say you wanted to be a singer, musician or actor.”
Connie Chiume

In 1976, she was a teacher earning R101 a month. For her relatives and close friends, this was a job she could not afford to gamble with, let alone lose.

But when Connie Chiume saw an advert in a local newspaper, calling for musicians, singers and actors to come in for auditions, she could not let the opportunity pass her by.

With just 25c in her pocket, the English, mathematics and Sesotho teacher made her way from Orlando in Soweto to Pritchard Street in Johannesburg, where she reconnected with her inner child and put on a performance that would set the stage for more than 40 years in the entertainment industry, a move that, to this day, she “does not regret”.

“I had been presented with an opportunity to travel abroad. I was going to be on a plane and, on top of that, I was going to earn R100 per week.

“I was not going to say no to that. I said: ‘I am going.’ And I did.”

After just a year, Chiume was thrust into the spotlight with her first acting role in the musical Sola Sola, with which she travelled abroad to countries such as Greece and Israel.

The septuagenarian who celebrated her 70th birthday on June 5 recalled:

""I had never been in showbiz, let alone received any sort of acting training. I went to the audition and was told that I was shortlisted. After hearing those words, I went straight to the casting director and asked him what that meant. I was a teacher at the time and I revealed that to him. I asked him to tell me right there and then what it meant, and, just like that, I was cast.""

NOW STREAMING - Silenced: The documentary

Babita Deokaran was a corruption whistle-blower within the Gauteng Department of Health, who was assassinated in a hit-style killing outside her south Johannesburg home in August 2021.

In her role as chief director: financial accounting, Deokaran had been a bulwark against irregular and dubious payments. Owing to her position, she was also in control of the evidentiary paper trail left by those who preyed on public funds, making her an invaluable asset to the Special Investigating Unit.

A News24 investigation which spanned more than a year – examining in excess of 60 000 e-mails and the contents of her cellphone – can reveal the vivid detail of what was her final graft investigation.

In this series, titled Silenced, we reveal what she found in the days before her murder.

'Our lives could be in danger: Inside Babita Deokaran's R850m 'fraud' probe

Babita Deokaran tried to stop R100 million in dodgy payments and flagged nearly R850 million in other suspicious transactions at the Gauteng Department of Health just days before she was killed - confiding in colleagues that her last investigation could result in her death.

""...I am just worried that the guys in Tembisa are going to realise we are not releasing their payments and know that we on to something. Our lives could be in danger,"" Deokaran said in a WhatsApp message to her boss.

Deokaran - a senior manager at the Gauteng health department - was ambushed by hitmen outside her home in Winchester Hills, south Johannesburg. She was shot nine times while pulling into her driveway after dropping off her daughter at school and later died in hospital. Her murder put an end to a decade of cooperation with the Special Investigating Unit and the Hawks as a critical witness within her department.

Nearly a year after she was murdered - drawing from a trove of more than 60 000 emails and the contents of her cellphone - News24 can reveal details of her final graft probe.

Babita Deokaran tried to stop ‘secret’ Tembisa Hospital payments to ANC leader

Three little-known companies headed by Gauteng ANC heavyweight Sello Sekhokho scored contracts providing medical supplies and equipment to Tembisa Hospital worth R2.3 million - his windfall flagged as ""potentially fraudulent"" by Department of Health chief accountant Babita Deokaran just three weeks before she was murdered.

One firm - Kaizen Projects - is among a network of 217 entities Deokaran identified as part of a flood of transactions out of Tembisa Hospital, her suspicion piqued by a buying spree which shot expenditure in July of 2021 sharply up. In a single month, goods and services for the tertiary hospital accounted for R239 million, 25% more than Charlotte Maxeke Academic Hospital, which is four times its size.

The whistleblower reported the splurge to department CFO Lerato Madyo and called for an immediate investigation and a stop on payments worth R104 million. Ten months after she was gunned down in a hit-style killing outside her south Johannesburg home, the payments out of the hospital have yet to be probed in their entirety.

No investigation, no protection: Inside department head's big lie to Babita Deokaran

Gauteng Health boss Lerato Madyo lied when she told Babita Deokaran that her discovery of R850m in dubious Tembisa Hospital payments had been bumped up the chain of command.

News24 can reveal that it was only on the day of Deokaran's assassination that Madyo mentioned to her superiors, in passing, that the whistleblower was worried her life was in danger after moving to halt payments to a politically connected businessman and hundreds of other companies.

Beyond this, the report in which Deokaran called for an urgent probe into the hospital's spending patterns was never formally escalated. Madyo received it three weeks before the murder.

Tembisa Hospital contract factory: R500k on leather loungers and letterbox barons unmasked

Tembisa Hospital bosses splurged R500 000 on 100 leather wingback chairs – this deal just one of a surge of dubious payments flagged by Babita Deokaran before she was assassinated.
A News24 investigation, drawing from key documents contained in thousands of Deokaran’s emails, can reveal that the East Rand hospital was turned into a contract factory. In four months, it processed more than 1 200 purchase orders worth more than R600 million.
While struggling with overcrowding, staff shortages and a dearth of funding, the hospital channelled nearly R60 million in payments to letterbox companies that exist only on paper. Twenty entities which simultaneously billed the hospital are controlled by four people. Each registered five companies on the same day and provided fake addresses when doing so.

Love me tender: How husband and wife bagged R30m in Tembisa Hospital contracts

A part-time call centre agent and her sound engineer husband landed Tembisa Hospital contracts worth nearly R30 million in the space of a month - part of a mammoth extraction network uncovered by murdered whistleblower Babita Deokaran.

Christine and Avikash Signarian each control five companies that saw a flurry of trade from the hospital, contracted to provide everything from ventilators to ICU beds.

Seventy payments to entities they own are among more than a thousand ""possibly fraudulent"" transactions flagged by Deokaran three weeks before she was assassinated. Her call for a forensic probe into the hospital’s buying patterns were ignored and payments worth R850 million are yet to be fully examined.

Under fire Tembisa hospital boss calls on ANC connections over News24 investigation

The Tembisa Hospital CEO, responsible for approving millions of rand in dodgy payments flagged by Babita Deokaran, has roped in his ANC connections because ""he is struggling with News24"".

This publication was contacted by a member of the ANC’s communications team on Tuesday to set up a meeting with hospital boss Ashley Mthunzi, after Mthunzi asked the convenor of the ANC’s Progressive Business Forum to intercede on his behalf.

The overtures by ANC operatives came despite various requests for comment to Mthunzi on what Deokaran found at Tembisa Hospital. These requests have however gone unanswered.

Tembisa Hospital’s R500 000 skinny jean spending spree... and the soccer star who scored

Tembisa Hospital bosses splurged R500 000 on a shipment of skinny jeans – purchased while South Africa was in the grip of the Covid-19 pandemic and just weeks before a third wave strained medical facilities to breaking point.

The payment for 200 pairs of denims - for girls aged between 6 and 7 – was flagged by Babita Deokaran alongside thousands of other transactions out of the East Rand hospital worth more than R850 million. She was assassinated three weeks later.

The jeans contract was awarded to an obscure company named Inez Chaste - one of 10 separate business entities controlled by retired soccer star Themba Shabalala and his wife Evelyn.

'We've heard nothing' from cops - Babita Deokaran's family as SIU investigation moves forward

Tembisa Hospital splurge exposed: leather loungers, skinny jeans, and R10 000 for a bucket

Four members of the Mazibuko clan control 17 separate entities that were flagged by whistleblower Babita Deokaran – three weeks before her murder – in a report that raised alarm over R850 million in ""possibly fraudulent"" payments out of the hospital.

A News24 investigation based on a trove of Gauteng health department e-mails can reveal that the family established a dynasty providing medical equipment and supplies to several health facilities in the province. But it was the Tembisa Hospital supply chain management office that delivered their heyday.

On 8 February 2021, two payments of R19 600 were processed for ""bucket heavy duty 12.5l plastic (sic)"". The hospital bought two in red and two in blue, and paid nearly 5 000% of the price it should have paid.

'Don of Tembisa' received millions in payments, bought Bantry Bay and Sandton mansions

Babita Deokaran red-flagged R36 million in Tembisa Hospital payments bound for companies linked to Hangwani Morgan Maumela, a high-flying tender tycoon whose property portfolio stretches from Bantry Bay to Sandton.

Twelve firms in his family network are among hundreds behind a dubious R850-million hospital buying spree that Deokaran reported to Gauteng health department bosses. She raised fears that stopping payments could place her life in danger. She was assassinated three weeks later.

Impeccable sources inside the health department described Maumela as ""the don"" of Tembisa Hospital, who held sway with management and had direct access to its procurement office.

Inside the 'confidential' Tembisa Hospital audit which was buried after Deokaran hit

A Gauteng health department audit of Tembisa Hospital launched after Babita Deokaran red-flagged R850 million in dodgy payments was buried for more than a year - and recommendations for an urgent investigation were abandoned.

Internal auditors found that hospital officials corrupted the procurement system and tampered with documents in order to channel contracts worth millions to companies which had been hand-picked to score big.

According to the confidential report filed in September last year, obtained by News24, auditors tested a random sample of just 18 individual payments – of 1 203 identified by Deokaran before her murder – and found that all were irregular.

The Tembisa tender 'don' and his cosy ties to Ramaphosa and key advisor

President Cyril Ramaphosa’s nephew by marriage – tender ""don"" Hangwani Morgan Maumela – is a central figure in the R850-million Tembisa Hospital procurement scandal first reported by Babita Deokaran before she was assassinated.

Through a web of companies, Maumela and his cousin scored R36 million in trade from the East Rand hospital in a period spanning only weeks – the transactions among more than a thousand now under investigation by Special Investigating Unit (SIU).

News24 can also reveal that the businessman’s links to the Union Buildings run deeper, with ties to Ramaphosa’s right-hand - principal political advisor Bejani Chauke. The pair are essentially neighbours in a plush Hyde Park security complex within walking distance of Ramaphosa’s private residence.

Camps Bay to Zimbali: Inside Tembisa tender don’s R280m property bonanza

A family trust controlled by Tembisa tender ""don"" Hangwani Morgan Maumela snapped up palatial homes across the country – amassing a R280-million property portfolio, that spans from Zimbali to Camps Bay, in the space of five years, News24 can reveal.

Maumela and a relative, through a network of twelve companies, banked R380 million in contracts for the supply of everything from décor to medical gear from the Gauteng health department since 2019.

Ten percent of these payments were red flagged by Babita Deokaran in a report into ""possibly fraudulent"" transactions out of Tembisa Hospital three weeks before she was murdered.

The 39-year-old businessman has ties that stretch to the Union Buildings - as a distant relative by marriage to President Cyril Ramaphosa, and neighbour and associate to his principal political advisor, Bejani Chauke.

How Tembisa Hospital’s R500k skinny jean supplier and shell corporation bosses flew the coop

The company behind the R500 000 Tembisa Hospital skinny jeans scandal has a new owner – a man who overnight become the controlling hand of 54 entities red-flagged by Babita Deokaran before her assassination.

Dr Stefan Joel Govindraju now directs the group of companies which saw R116 million in dubious trade from the hospital, his conglomerate accounting for nearly a quarter of the 217 ""possibly fraudulent"" entities unearthed by the whistleblower.

In two days, company directors resigned en masse, and ceded control to him. The companies – shell corporations that used false addresses and exist only on paper - form part of an extraction network that scored hundreds of contracts from the East Rand health facility, providing everything from luxury leather furniture to ventilators.

Mother of Tembisa tender ‘don’ scores R30m Sea Point property as tenderpreneur network expands

Mboneni Maumela – a retiree and elderly mother of Tembisa Hospital tender tycoon Hangwani Morgan Maumela – splurged R30 million on two Sea Point flats, pushing up the value of the family’s property portfolio north of R310 million.

On the same day in March this year, the 66-year-old became the owner of units 49 and 133 in the luxury Twin Towers block, with views of the Atlantic seaboard and flanked by the Sea Point promenade. Each unit cost R14.5 million, according to deeds office records.

While the source of her wealth remains unknown, the former civil servant appears to be backed by her son who, along with his cousin Aluwani Maumela, raked in R381 million in contracts from Gauteng state hospitals in three years, with 93% of their heyday coming from Tembisa.

Kaizen Projects, Nokokhokho, and Bollanoto Security were among hundreds of Tembisa Hospital suppliers Babita Deokaran flagged three weeks before her assassination – and a News24 investigation first identified a string of deals worth R2.3 million pushed his way.

New Tembisa Hospital tender don Stefan Govindraju – who took control of an empire of companies which scored R116 million in deals red-flagged by Babita Deokaran – has longstanding links to an extraction network that saw bank tellers, call-centre agents and sound technicians become overnight millionaires.

After News24 exposed the hospital tender mafia, company directors inexplicably resigned en masse and ceded control to Govindraju. His takeover played out in less than 48 hours.

News24 can now reveal Govindraju’s connection to the companies - behind a flood of unregulated medical equipment sold to the hospital - as the final link in a chain of lovers, relatives, friends, and co-workers.

SIU unravels R1 billion Tembisa tender syndicates

The Special Investigating Unit (SIU) recommended Tembisa Hospital tender kingpins Hangwani Maumela and Stefan Govindraju – whose companies landed contracts worth R775 million in less than two years - face prosecution for fraud.

A preliminary SIU report released on Tuesday found that networks of shell corporations banked more than R1 billion in dubious payments from the impoverished hospital. These syndicates and those behind them were first exposed by News24 in a series titled Silenced.

Investigators uncovered evidence that Maumela and Govindraju, through companies they controlled, in some cases, provided fake documents to the Gauteng Department of Health which paved the way for a flood of payments.

Tembisa Hospital's R500 000 chicken tender, and how the inside men feathered the nest

Tembisa Hospital splurged R500 000 on six tons of frozen chicken in a deal tainted by irregularities, false documents and price inflation. This payment is one of hundreds now in the crosshairs of the Special Investigating Unit.

The graft-busting squad found that hospital officials flouted buying processes, a key enabler for a tender mafia first identified by Babita Deokaran three weeks before she was assassinated.

Those officials who swung dicey contracts are still at work, and some are still in charge of procurement.

The contract was awarded to an unknown company named Fairg Holdings, which operates from a rundown house in suburban Benoni on the East Rand.

SIU investigators concluded that falsified and altered documents were overlooked in order to close the deal - with a price nearly double what it should have been.

Tembisa tender tycoon, his 'mama cat', and their brazen blue-light brigade

Tembisa Hospital tender tycoon Vusimuzi Matlala – whose companies scored nearly R5 million in contracts red-flagged by Babita Deokaran – is now under investigation for his illegal blue-light cavalcade used for airport trips and school runs.

Matlala’s partner Cordelia Kabeng, calling herself ""mama cat"", boasted to her 12 000 Instagram followers about her high-speed escorts, replete with lights and sirens, to drop off her ""cubs"".

Matlala has close ties to Hangwani Morgan Maumela, the central node in an extraction syndicate of little-known companies and opaque trusts which saw R23 million in dicey payments channelled their way.

Tembisa tender mafia: Syndicates expand, and look to other hospital feeding troughs

Front company kingpin Stefan Govindraju - who controls a tender extraction network which bled R440 million from Tembisa Hospital - has been linked to more shady state suppliers, with worrying signals that the contract feeding frenzy stretches into other hospitals.

Five of his companies, outside of 217 ""possibly fraudulent"" entities red-flagged by Babita Deokaran before her assassination, are now under investigation by the Gauteng Department of Health after irregularities were discovered in the way they operate.

'Are u ok?' Crucial Tembisa Hospital corruption evidence stolen

Suspended Gauteng health department boss Lerato Madyo’s cellphone – a critical piece of evidence in a R850-million fraud and corruption probe into Tembisa Hospital – was stolen before cops could analyse it.

The phone – with its record of a WhatsApp chat between Madyo and whistleblower Babita Deokaran – was reported stolen in March last year.

In the weeks before she was murdered, Deokaran briefed Madyo about her concerns over Tembisa Hospital spending, fears that her life was in danger, and misgivings surrounding lucrative contracts scored by an ANC politician, according to a history of near-daily conversations, obtained by News24.

'They took my phone': Hawks raid ANC bigwig in R1bn Tembisa corruption scandal

Flashy ANC boss Sello Sekhokho and his fleet of companies - that scored nearly R100 million in shady contracts from Gauteng hospitals in just three years – are in the crosshairs of a R1-billion Tembisa Hospital fraud and corruption probe.

Early on Wednesday morning, Hawks detectives swooped on Sekhokho's home and two properties from which he runs his business empire, seizing documents, computers and cellphones.

A company named Kaizen Projects – controlled by the 37-year-old politician – was among the first of 217 entities redflagged by whistleblower Babita Deokaran, after she noticed a surge in spending out of Tembisa Hospital. Three weeks after she reported concerns over the legitimacy of the company and others, she was assassinated outside her home.

R250m Tembisa Hospital extraction syndicate is still scoring tenders

A company that forms part of the extraction syndicate which banked R250 million in shady Tembisa Hospital contracts, was paid nearly R1 million by the Gauteng Department of Health – after it was red-flagged by the Special Investigating Unit.

The little-known company called Minzorex scored two contracts from Edenvale Hospital and was paid R985 100 in two transactions – the last lump sum landing in the firm's bank account in January.

The big score: Tembisa tender kings 'inflated' prices for embattled hospital by up to 2 000%

Gauteng Department of Health boss Lerato Madyo and Tembisa Hospital CEO Ashley Mthunzi signed off on medical supply contracts with grossly inflated prices, overlooking a litany of discrepancies, including forged documents.

In one instance, the price of surgical drapes was gouged by nearly 2 000%.

Last month, the pair were each charged with misconduct during internal disciplinary action arising from 13 transactions they approved, among more than a thousand dubious payments flagged by provincial financial manager Babita Deokaran before her murder. They both now face dismissal if found guilty.

Now nearly 900 pages of documentary evidence, which underpins misconduct allegations, have been filed in the disciplinary inquiry. This trove of bid documents, quotes and purchase orders reveal how easily supply chain management prescripts were flouted and bypassed, and how prices soared.

'Fraud', 'forgery' and Tembisa tender kingpin's 300% markup: This is how he did it

Three companies with secret ties to front company kingpin Stefan Govindraju bid against one another for a lucrative Tembisa Hospital deal - the tainted contract now linked to a R440-million tender extraction syndicate.

This deal saw Tembisa Hospital pay 300% more than they should have for sutures, News24 can reveal.

In another, a company linked to Govindraju submitted forged documents which allowed them to win a supply contract for ventilator parts worth R496 000. These dubious transactions are among thousands of payments flagged by Babita Deokaran just weeks before she was assassinated outside her home.

'I know nothing': How a pool cleaner, unemployed guard were used to 'cook' Tembisa tenders

Two Limpopo women, one a municipal worker and the other an unemployed security guard, became unwitting bedfellows when their ""stolen"" identities were used in a scheme to rig a lucrative Tembisa Hospital contract, News24 can reveal.

Raesibe Motebejano spends her days cleaning the Polokwane Municipality's public swimming pools. The 44-year-old's signature also appears on bid documents for an entity called Black AK Trading and Suppliers, which tendered for a supplier contract from the East Rand Hospital.

Tembisa tender 'don's' luxury properties flash sale and the realtors who kept it 'secret'

Tembisa Hospital tender ""don"" Hangwani Morgan Maumela is selling off chunks of his R280 million property portfolio in a hurry – and a boutique real estate agency has seemingly helped him avoid the prying eyes of the Special Investigating Unit.

Maumela – President Cyril Ramaphosa's nephew from a previous marriage – was named by the SIU as a central figure in a R1 billion extraction scheme at the healthcare facility. A network of companies tied to Maumela and hundreds of payments from Tembisa Hospital were first discovered by Babita Deokaran before she was assassinated in August 2021.

News24 can reveal that in one property deal, the R14 million sale of a Hurlingham mansion in April, Live Real Estate and agents Brendan Miller and Jacqui Steinmann allegedly knew that Maumela was under investigation by the SIU – and pushed the sale in secret.

<p>Babita Deokaran was a corruption whistle-blower within the Gauteng Department of Health, who was assassinated in a hit-style killing outside her south Johannesburg home in August 2021.</p>

<p>In her role as chief director: financial accounting, Deokaran had been a bulwark against irregular and dubious payments. Owing to her position, she was also in control of the evidentiary paper trail left by those who preyed on public funds, making her an invaluable asset to the Special Investigating Unit.</p>

<p>A News24 investigation which spanned more than a year – examining in excess of 60 000 e-mails and the contents of her cellphone – can reveal the vivid detail of what was her final graft investigation.</p>

<p>In this series, titled <em>Silenced, </em>we reveal what she found in the days before her murder.</p>

<h3><strong>'Our lives could be in danger: Inside Babita Deokaran's R850m 'fraud' probe</strong></h3>

<p>Babita Deokaran tried to stop R100 million in dodgy payments and flagged nearly R850 million in other suspicious transactions at the Gauteng Department of Health just days before she was killed - confiding in colleagues that her last investigation could result in her death.</p>

<p>""...I am just worried that the guys in Tembisa are going to realise we are not releasing their payments and know that we on to something. Our lives could be in danger,"" Deokaran said in a WhatsApp message to her boss.</p>

<p>Deokaran - a senior manager at the Gauteng health department - was ambushed by hitmen outside her home in Winchester Hills, south Johannesburg. She was shot nine times while pulling into her driveway after dropping off her daughter at school and later died in hospital. Her murder put an end to a decade of cooperation with the Special Investigating Unit and the Hawks as a critical witness within her department.</p>

<p>Nearly a year after she was murdered - drawing from a trove of more than 60 000 emails and the contents of her cellphone - News24 can reveal details of her final graft probe.</p>

<h3>Babita Deokaran tried to stop ‘secret’ Tembisa Hospital payments to ANC leader</h3>

<p>Three little-known companies headed by Gauteng ANC heavyweight Sello Sekhokho scored contracts providing medical supplies and equipment to Tembisa Hospital worth R2.3 million - his windfall flagged as ""potentially fraudulent"" by Department of Health chief accountant Babita Deokaran just three weeks before she was murdered.</p>

<p>One firm - Kaizen Projects - is among a network of 217 entities Deokaran identified as part of a flood of transactions out of Tembisa Hospital, her suspicion piqued by a buying spree which shot expenditure in July of 2021 sharply up. In a single month, goods and services for the tertiary hospital accounted for R239 million, 25% more than Charlotte Maxeke Academic Hospital, which is four times its size.</p>

<p>The whistleblower reported the splurge to department CFO Lerato Madyo and called for an immediate investigation and a stop on payments worth R104 million. Ten months after she was gunned down in a hit-style killing outside her south Johannesburg home, the payments out of the hospital have yet to be probed in their entirety.</p>

<h3>No investigation, no protection: Inside department head's big lie to Babita Deokaran</h3>

<p>Gauteng Health boss Lerato Madyo lied when she told Babita Deokaran that her discovery of R850m in dubious Tembisa Hospital payments had been bumped up the chain of command.</p>

<p>News24 can reveal that it was only on the day of Deokaran's assassination that Madyo mentioned to her superiors, in passing, that the whistleblower was worried her life was in danger after moving to halt payments to a politically connected businessman and hundreds of other companies.</p>

<p>Beyond this, the report in which Deokaran called for an urgent probe into the hospital's spending patterns was never formally escalated. Madyo received it three weeks before the murder.</p>

<h3>Tembisa Hospital contract factory: R500k on leather loungers and letterbox barons unmasked</h3>

<p>Tembisa Hospital bosses splurged R500 000 on 100 leather wingback chairs – this deal just one of a surge of dubious payments flagged by Babita Deokaran before she was assassinated. <br><br>A News24 investigation, drawing from key documents contained in thousands of Deokaran’s emails, can reveal that the East Rand hospital was turned into a contract factory. In four months, it processed more than 1 200 purchase orders worth more than R600 million.<br><br>While struggling with overcrowding, staff shortages and a dearth of funding, the hospital channelled nearly R60 million in payments to letterbox companies that exist only on paper. Twenty entities which simultaneously billed the hospital are controlled by four people. Each registered five companies on the same day and provided fake addresses when doing so.</p>

<p>Seventy payments to entities they own are among more than a thousand ""possibly fraudulent"" transactions flagged by Deokaran three weeks before she was assassinated.

<p>The overtures by ANC operatives came despite various requests for comment to Mthunzi on what Deokaran found at Tembisa Hospital. These requests have however gone unanswered.</p>

<h3>Tembisa Hospital’s R500 000 skinny jean spending spree... and the soccer star who scored</h3>

<p>The payment for 200 pairs of denims - for girls aged between 6 and 7 – was flagged by Babita Deokaran alongside thousands of other transactions out of the East Rand hospital worth more than R850 million. She was assassinated three weeks later.</p>

<p><br>On 8 February 2021, two payments of R19 600 were processed for ""bucket heavy duty 12.5l plastic (sic)"". The hospital bought two in red and two in blue, and paid nearly 5 000% of the price it should have paid.</p>

<p>A Gauteng health department audit of Tembisa Hospital launched after Babita Deokaran red-flagged R850 million in dodgy payments was buried for more than a year - and recommendations for an urgent investigation were abandoned.</p>

<p>Internal auditors found that hospital officials corrupted the procurement system and tampered with documents in order to channel contracts worth millions to companies which had been hand-picked to score big.</p>

<p>According to the confidential report filed in September last year, obtained by News24, auditors tested a random sample of just 18 individual payments – of 1 203 identified by Deokaran before her murder – and found that all were irregular.</p>

<p>Through a web of companies, Maumela and his cousin scored R36 million in trade from the East Rand hospital in a period spanning only weeks – the transactions among more than a thousand now under investigation by Special Investigating Unit (SIU).</p>

<p>News24 can also reveal that the businessman’s links to the Union Buildings run deeper, with ties to Ramaphosa’s right-hand - principal political advisor Bejani Chauke.

<p>In two days, company directors resigned en masse, and ceded control to him. The companies – shell corporations that used false addresses and exist only on paper - form part of an extraction network that scored hundreds of contracts from the East Rand health facility, providing everything from luxury leather furniture to ventilators.</p>

<p>After News24 exposed the hospital tender mafia, company directors inexplicably resigned en masse and ceded control to Govindraju. His takeover played out in less than 48 hours.</p>

<p>News24 can now reveal Govindraju’s connection to the companies - behind a flood of unregulated medical equipment sold to the hospital - as the final link in a chain of lovers, relatives, friends, and co-workers.</p>

<h3>SIU unravels R1 billion Tembisa tender syndicates</h3>

<p>The Special Investigating Unit (SIU) recommended Tembisa Hospital tender kingpins Hangwani Maumela and Stefan Govindraju – whose companies landed contracts worth R775 million in less than two years - face prosecution for fraud.</p>

<p>A preliminary SIU report released on Tuesday found that networks of shell corporations banked more than R1 billion in dubious payments from the impoverished hospital. These syndicates and those behind them were first exposed by News24 in a series titled Silenced.</p>

<p>Investigators uncovered evidence that Maumela and Govindraju, through companies they controlled, in some cases, provided fake documents to the Gauteng Department of Health which paved the way for a flood of payments.</p>

<h3>Tembisa Hospital's R500 000 chicken tender, and how the inside men feathered the nest</h3>

<p>Tembisa Hospital splurged R500 000 on six tons of frozen chicken in a deal tainted by irregularities, false documents and price inflation. This payment is one of hundreds now in the crosshairs of the Special Investigating Unit.</p>

<p>The graft-busting squad found that hospital officials flouted buying processes, a key enabler for a tender mafia first identified by Babita Deokaran three weeks before she was assassinated.</p>

<p>Those officials who swung dicey contracts are still at work, and some are still in charge of procurement.</p>

<p>The contract was awarded to an unknown company named Fairg Holdings, which operates from a rundown house in suburban Benoni on the East Rand.</p>

<p>SIU investigators concluded that falsified and altered documents were overlooked in order to close the deal - with a price nearly double what it should have been.</p>

<h3>Tembisa tender tycoon, his 'mama cat', and their brazen blue-light brigade</h3>

<p>Tembisa Hospital tender tycoon Vusimuzi Matlala – whose companies scored nearly R5 million in contracts red-flagged by Babita Deokaran – is now under investigation for his illegal blue-light cavalcade used for airport trips and school runs.</p>

<p>Matlala’s partner Cordelia Kabeng, calling herself ""mama cat"", boasted to her 12 000 Instagram followers about her high-speed escorts, replete with lights and sirens, to drop off her ""cubs"".</p>

<p>Matlala has close ties to Hangwani Morgan Maumela, the central node in an extraction syndicate of little-known companies and opaque trusts which saw R23 million in dicey payments channelled their way.</p>

<h3>Tembisa tender mafia: Syndicates expand, and look to other hospital feeding troughs</h3>

<p>Front company kingpin Stefan Govindraju - who controls a tender extraction network which bled R440 million from Tembisa Hospital - has been linked to more shady state suppliers, with worrying signals that the contract feeding frenzy stretches into other hospitals.</p>

<p>Five of his companies, outside of 217 ""possibly fraudulent"" entities red-flagged by Babita Deokaran before her assassination, are now under investigation by the Gauteng Department of Health after irregularities were discovered in the way they operate.</p>

<h2>'Are u ok?' Crucial Tembisa Hospital corruption evidence stolen</h2>

<p>Suspended Gauteng health department boss Lerato Madyo’s cellphone – a critical piece of evidence in a R850-million fraud and corruption probe into Tembisa Hospital – was stolen before cops could analyse it.</p>

<p>The phone – with its record of a WhatsApp chat between Madyo and <a href=""https://specialprojects.news24.com/silenced/index.html"">whistleblower Babita Deokaran</a> – was reported stolen in March last year.</p>

<p>In the weeks before she was murdered, Deokaran briefed Madyo about her concerns over Tembisa Hospital spending, fears that her life was in danger, and misgivings surrounding lucrative contracts scored by an ANC politician, according to a history of near-daily conversations, obtained by News24. <br></p>

<h2>'They took my phone': Hawks raid ANC bigwig in R1bn Tembisa corruption scandal</h2>

<p>Flashy ANC boss Sello Sekhokho and his fleet of companies - that scored nearly R100 million in shady contracts from Gauteng hospitals in just three years – are in the crosshairs of a R1-billion Tembisa Hospital fraud and corruption probe.</p>

<p>Early on Wednesday morning, Hawks detectives swooped on Sekhokho's home and two properties from which he runs his business empire, seizing documents, computers and cellphones.</p>

<p>A company named Kaizen Projects – controlled by the 37-year-old politician – was among the first of 217 entities redflagged by whistleblower Babita Deokaran, after she noticed a surge in spending out of Tembisa Hospital. Three weeks after she reported concerns over the legitimacy of the company and others, she was assassinated outside her home.<br></p>

<h2>R250m Tembisa Hospital extraction syndicate is still scoring tenders</h2>

<p>A company that forms part of the extraction syndicate which banked R250 million in shady Tembisa Hospital contracts, was paid nearly R1 million by the Gauteng Department of Health – after it was red-flagged by the Special Investigating Unit.</p>

<p>The little-known company called Minzorex scored two contracts from Edenvale Hospital and was paid R985 100 in two transactions – the last lump sum landing in the firm's bank account in January.  <br></p>

<h2>The big score: Tembisa tender kings 'inflated' prices for embattled hospital by up to 2 000%</h2>

<p>Gauteng Department of Health boss Lerato Madyo and Tembisa Hospital CEO Ashley Mthunzi signed off on medical supply contracts with grossly inflated prices, overlooking a litany of discrepancies, including forged documents.</p>

<p>In one instance, the price of surgical drapes was gouged by nearly 2 000%.</p>

<p>Last month, the pair were each charged with misconduct during internal disciplinary action arising from 13 transactions they approved, among more than a thousand dubious payments flagged by provincial financial manager Babita Deokaran before her murder. They both now face dismissal if found guilty.</p>

<p>Now nearly 900 pages of documentary evidence, which underpins misconduct allegations, have been filed in the disciplinary inquiry. This trove of bid documents, quotes and purchase orders reveal how easily supply chain management prescripts were flouted and bypassed, and how prices soared.</p>

<h2>'Fraud', 'forgery' and Tembisa tender kingpin's 300% markup: This is how he did it</h2>

<p>Three companies with secret ties to front company kingpin Stefan Govindraju bid against one another for a lucrative Tembisa Hospital deal - the tainted contract now linked to a R440-million tender extraction syndicate.</p>

<p>This deal saw Tembisa Hospital pay 300% more than they should have for sutures, News24 can reveal.</p>

<p>In another, a company linked to Govindraju submitted forged documents which allowed them to win a supply contract for ventilator parts worth R496 000. These dubious transactions are among thousands of payments flagged by Babita Deokaran just weeks before she was assassinated outside her home.<br></p>

<h2>'I know nothing': How a pool cleaner, unemployed guard were used to 'cook' Tembisa tenders</h2>

<p>Two Limpopo women, one a municipal worker and the other an unemployed security guard, became unwitting bedfellows when their ""stolen"" identities were used in a scheme to rig a lucrative Tembisa Hospital contract, News24 can reveal.</p>

<p>Raesibe Motebejano spends her days cleaning the Polokwane Municipality's public swimming pools. The 44-year-old's signature also appears on bid documents for an entity called Black AK Trading and Suppliers, which tendered for a supplier contract from the East Rand Hospital.</p>

<h2>Tembisa tender 'don's' luxury properties flash sale and the realtors who kept it 'secret'</h2>

<p>Tembisa Hospital tender ""don"" Hangwani Morgan Maumela is selling off chunks of his R280 million property portfolio in a hurry – and a boutique real estate agency has seemingly helped him avoid the prying eyes of the Special Investigating Unit.</p>

<p>Maumela – President Cyril Ramaphosa's nephew from a previous marriage – was named by the SIU as a central figure in a R1 billion extraction scheme at the healthcare facility. A network of companies tied to Maumela and hundreds of payments from Tembisa Hospital were first discovered by Babita Deokaran before she was assassinated in August 2021.</p>

<p>News24 can reveal that in one property deal, the R14 million sale of a Hurlingham mansion in April, Live Real Estate and agents Brendan Miller and Jacqui Steinmann allegedly knew that Maumela was under investigation by the SIU – and pushed the sale in secret. <br></p>

DRUM editor Thulani Gqirana

‘I know I can be what I want to be, if I work hard at it, I’ll be where I want to be.’

They might be lyrics to a rap song but these 51 women are living proof that dreams do come true and sometimes it takes more than one try to make it, but make it you will.

These 51 women are who we all want to be when we grow up. They show that whether you are in the arts field, or engineering, farming or property and any of the other many fields we covered here, there are no limits.

Here at Drum, we celebrate women in all their seasons. Whether they are in their winning season, or hustling or in their time of rest, they all deserve to be celebrated.

This Women’s Month, we decided to give some love to these women who are in their boss era. They’ve worked hard and it’s paid off, in spades.

So today and every day, we salute them as well as their mothers, grandmothers, aunts and neighbours who had a hand in inspiring their path.

May they also serve as inspiration for the next generation.

"","Home improvements and makeovers range from painted walls to trendy feature tiles, lighting and backyard conversions. Most of these are not only great to add value to your life, but your property as well and could make it more attractive to buyers according to the Seeff Property Group.

If it is an older home and you have equity that you can leverage, then giving it a good make-over with a new kitchen and bathrooms could add value, but you could also just do a few cost-effective cosmetic upgrades. You should, however, always weigh the renovation costs against the benefit, and keep it neutral when you want to sell. Green walls and plenty of plants are great, but not everybody’s taste.

It is important to distinguish between what will add value to your lifestyle, and what will add value to your property. Recent sales prices in the area can provide insight into how much more your property could sell for with improvements, and prevent overcapitalising with extravagant additions or finishes which do not add extra value.

Tastes differ, so when the time comes to sell, consult with a local estate agent because you may need to tone down some of the colour, plants and décor to get the property sold. Always keep the upgrades in line with other properties in the area. The property should not stand out like a sore thumb in the neighbourhood.

That said, upgrading a property often starts a trend in the area and neighbours may follow suit, all of which will contribute to making the area more attractive to buyers who will often then be willing to pay more for a trendy home. Upgrades are a great way to turn rather drab areas into trendy neighbourhoods according to Seeff.

Seeff’s agents highlight some cost-effective improvements which can increase the value and make the property more attractive to buyers.

Repainting. New modern colours such as grey, green and even black are all the rage right now, but it does not have to be as dramatic as that. Even just upgrading the exterior and interior in new paint tones, albeit fairly neutral, can add value and could spark buyer interest.

Floors and tiled areas. Floors can be modernised with wooden or laminate flooring, or feature tiles in the latest trends, or new carpets. Wall tiles can also be replaced to give an instant update to the appearance of the kitchen and bathrooms.

Kitchen and bathrooms. If you are unable to do a complete remodel, consider cosmetic upgrades such as painting the cupboards, fitting new handles, adding open shelves, a new stove and appliances, new bathroom fittings, new mirrors and new towels.

Doors and bedroom cupboards. Another cost-effective way to upgrade is to change the door and cupboard handles given that there is now such a wide choice available. If the cupboards are old, you can repaint and modernise rather than replace.

New lighting and window coverings. You can also consider upgrading exterior and interior lighting to modernise the home. Upgrade your curtains or add American shutters or wooden blinds. You could also change from kirsch rails to rods to give it a modern touch.

Convert your patio into a braai room. If you have a patio, consider enclosing it and adding a built-in braai, and sliding or stacking doors to open it to the garden. This will enable you to enjoy year-round braai get togethers regardless of the weather, and add value.

Update the garden. Aside from general maintenance, you can add outdoor pots, or paint your pots or old garden furniture to give it a new lease on life. Adding pathways and garden décor can add interest to the garden.

Here is a look back at some of David Jacobs', Gauteng Regional Manager for the Rawson Property Group, favourite DIY home improvement ideas:

Countertops

Great countertops make a big difference to both a kitchen’s appearance and the cooking experience. Granite, Caesarstone and marble counters are always crowd favourites, but they do cost a fair bit and need to be installed by professionals. Timber and Formica are much more approachable and affordable for the DIY family, and can be just as attractive if they’re chosen and installed well.

When selecting a Formica finish, Jacobs recommends avoiding dated options like faux granite or marble.

Modern wood grains and minimalist textures give the best results. A square edge profile rather than the traditional quarter-round also adds a more contemporary flavour.

For the more adventurous DIYer, there are also options like casting your own concrete countertops. Just keep in mind the general style of your home, and make sure your countertop choice enhances its surroundings.

Your garage

Garages may not seem like the most important part of a home, but Jacobs says homeowners can add a lot of value to their property by turning them into more functional spaces.

Garages are often underutilised. They’re ideal spaces for adding extra storage - something that is very important to a lot of buyers, and can often accommodate a mini workbench or laundry area with a little planning.

While adding a laundry corner to your garage would require a plumber, storage is an easy weekend DIY for the handyperson in your home.

You can buy ready-made cupboards and shelves from your local hardware store, but budget-conscious DIYers can also try second-hand websites to find old kitchen cabinets to mount along their garage walls.

For those with less available space, hanging storage may be a better option. Try pegboard walls with hooks for holding everything from bicycles to lawnmowers and secateurs.","<article>

"","My journey into the world of food and storytelling began with the publication of my first cookbook, ""Johanne 14,"" in 2017.

This book is a delightful fusion of traditional South African recipes with a contemporary twist, interwoven with nostalgic tales of days gone by. Through ""Johanne 14,"" I aimed to showcase the resilience of our culture and its profound influence on our culinary traditions. It was an honour to represent Africa at the Gourmand Awards in China, competing in the Best Heritage Book in the World category. My roots trace back to Jouberton, a township in Klerksdorp, where I savoured the flavours of traditional Sotho cuisine prepared by my father, who worked in a mine kitchen.

After completing my culinary studies at The Professional Cooking Academy in Rustenberg, I settled in Cape Town. In Cape Town, I faced the challenges of balancing multiple jobs to make ends meet while gaining valuable experience at various restaurants.

My journey led me to collaborate with the renowned chef Siba Mtongana during her time at Media24. I served as her assistant, contributing to recipe development and cooking for DRUM magazine. As time passed, I achieved the remarkable milestone of becoming South Africa's first black male food editor. During my tenure at DRUM, I won the prestigious Galliova Award for Best Food Writer of the Year for two consecutive years in 2015 and 2016.

In 2017, I furthered my culinary journey at Woolworths Taste magazine as the deputy food editor, exploring the chic and glossy side of gastronomy. My passion lies in showcasing the rich tapestry of African cuisine to the world. I am a pioneer on a mission to educate and celebrate the diverse flavors of African foods. It fills me with pride to have authored a book that pays tribute to the simple, traditional flavors of Mzansi, brimming with proudly South African dishes.

Dairy has long been a staple of South Africans with products like amasi, milk, yoghurt and cheese forming part of traditional and street food. And for good reason, too. Not only does it add taste, flavour and many important nutrients to your diet, but it is your bone-building partner throughout life. Consider this: one glass of amasi provides almost 50% of your daily requirement of Vitamin B12 - needed for a sharp brain and memory, 30% of your daily calcium needs to ensure strong bones and teeth, and 20% of your potassium needs to keep your heart healthy. Now keep scrolling for my Yoghurt Roosterkoek with BBQ Lamb... Mmmm!

This yoghurt roosterkoek comes ready-made with that extra batch of nutrients your body needs.

Lamb

2kg lamb

15ml (1tbsp) BBQ spice

15ml (1tbsp) cumin

15ml (1tbsp) paprika

2,5ml (½ tsp) chilli powder

handful lamb fat

Salad

Cheddar cheese, cubed

2 tomatoes, chopped

½ onion, diced

1 green pepper, chopped

3 Tbsp atchar

1 tsp paprika

½ cayenne pepper

1 lemon juice or 3T vinegar

salt to taste

Roosterkoek

200ml warm water

10g yeast

20ml sugar

750ml flour

5ml salt

30ml (2 tbsp) oil

200ml double cream yoghurt

METHOD

1. Roosterkoek: Mix water, yeast and sugar in a jug.
2. In a large bowl add flour, salt and the yeast mixture. Mix by hand to make a ball. Knead on a floured surface or cutting board until soft dough forms.
3. Place dough in a oiled bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Allow dough to double in size for 50 minutes.
4. Divide dough into 12 balls and set aside for 20 minutes to double again.
5. Place on griller and toast each side for 3 minutes turning for 10 minutes or until cooked inside.
6. Lamb: Mix BBQ spice, cumin, paprika and chilli in a bowl. Add lamb to coat well.
7. Grill lamb with pieces of fat to melt over the meat. Toss the meat and cutting thick pieces during cooking over medium heat for 10 minutes or until cooked.
8. Salad: Mix all ingredients in a bowl.

Yoghurt contains good-quality protein, probiotics and all the other nutrients found in milk, such as calcium, vitamin B2, vitamin B12, potassium, magnesium and vitamin A.
To make the most of the nutrients and probiotics in your diet, enjoy it as a healthy snack with fruit, or mix with garlic and fresh herbs as salad dressing.

Adding amasi to a chicken renders it soft and tender, and adds that creamy, almost tangy taste to your dish. Amasi is a traditional ingredient that used to be made overnight in clay pots, and today it is still used for its unique flavour and goodness.

1 whole chicken

500ml amasi

salt and pepper

garlic

BBQ spice

METHOD

1. Mix all the ingredients for the amasi marinade in a very large ziplock bag, insert the chicken, and ensure the chicken is properly covered.
2. Marinade overnight by placing the ziplock with chicken and other ingredients in the fridge.
3. Grill over medium heat for 20 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through.

One glass of amasi contains 50% of your daily vitamin B12 requirement, 30% of your daily calcium requirement and 20% of your daily potassium requirement. It also gives you vitamin A and good-quality protein. Make it part of your daily diet by enjoying it as an anytime drink, pouring it over your pap, using it as a substitute for buttermilk or yoghurt when baking, or adding it to soups, pasta, smoothies, dips and sauces. It’s also an excellent recovery drink after exercise.

Through ""Johanne 14,"" I aimed to showcase the resilience of our culture and its profound influence on our culinary traditions. It was an honour to represent Africa at the Gourmand Awards in China, competing in the Best Heritage Book in the World category. My roots trace back to Jouberton, a township in Klerksdorp, where I savoured the flavours of traditional Sotho cuisine prepared by my father, who worked in a mine kitchen.</p>

<p>After completing my culinary studies at The Professional Cooking Academy in Rustenberg, I settled in Cape Town. In Cape Town, I faced the challenges of balancing multiple jobs to make ends meet while gaining valuable experience at various restaurants.</p>

<figure data-lazyload-container=""true"" data-lazyload-trigger=""true""><img alt="""" src=""""></figure>

<p>My journey led me to collaborate with the renowned chef Siba Mtongana during her time at Media24. I served as her assistant, contributing to recipe development and cooking for DRUM magazine. As time passed, I achieved the remarkable milestone of becoming South Africa's first black male food editor. During my tenure at DRUM, I won the prestigious Galliova Award for Best Food Writer of the Year for two consecutive years in 2015 and 2016.</p>

<p>In 2017, I furthered my culinary journey at Woolworths Taste magazine as the deputy food editor, exploring the chic and glossy side of gastronomy. My passion lies in showcasing the rich tapestry of African cuisine to the world. I am a pioneer on a mission to educate and celebrate the diverse flavors of African foods. It fills me with pride to have authored a book that pays tribute to the simple, traditional flavors of Mzansi, brimming with proudly South African dishes.</p>

<p>Dairy has long been a staple of South Africans with products like amasi, milk, yoghurt and cheese forming part of traditional and street food. And for good reason, too. Not only does it add taste, flavour and many important nutrients to your diet, but it is your bone-building partner throughout life. Consider this: one glass of amasi provides almost 50% of your daily requirement of Vitamin B12 - needed for a sharp brain and memory, 30% of your daily calcium needs to ensure strong bones and teeth, and 20% of your potassium needs to keep your heart healthy. Now keep scrolling for my Yoghurt Roosterkoek with BBQ Lamb... Mmmm!</p>

<p>This yoghurt roosterkoek comes ready-made with that extra batch of nutrients your body needs.</p>

<p><strong>Lamb</strong></p>

<p>2kg lamb</p>

<p>15ml (1tbsp) BBQ spice</p>

<p>15ml (1tbsp) cumin</p>

<p>2 tomatoes, chopped</p>

<p>½ onion, diced</p>

<p>1 green pepper, chopped</p>

<p>3 Tbsp atchar</p>

<p>1 tsp paprika</p>

<p>½ cayenne pepper</p>

<p>1 lemon juice or 3T vinegar</p>

<p><strong>METHOD</strong></p>

<p>1. <strong>Roosterkoek: </strong>Mix water, yeast and sugar in a jug.<br>2. In a large bowl add flour, salt and the yeast mixture. Mix by hand to make a ball. Knead on a floured surface or cutting board until soft dough forms.<br>3. Place dough in a oiled bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Allow dough to double in size for 50 minutes.<br>4. Divide dough into 12 balls and set aside for 20 minutes to double again.<br>5. Place on griller and toast each side for 3 minutes turning for 10 minutes or until cooked inside.<br>6. <strong>Lamb: </strong>Mix BBQ spice, cumin, paprika and chilli in a bowl. Add lamb to coat well.<br>7. Grill lamb with pieces of fat to melt over the meat. Toss the meat and cutting thick pieces during cooking over medium heat for 10 minutes or until cooked.<br>8. <strong>Salad: </strong>Mix all ingredients in a bowl.</p>

<figure data-lazyload-container=""true"" data-lazyload-trigger=""true""><img alt="""" src=""""></figure>

<p><strong>Yoghurt contains good-quality protein, probiotics and all the other nutrients found in milk, such as calcium, vitamin B2, vitamin B12, potassium, magnesium and vitamin A. </strong><br>To make the most of the nutrients and probiotics in your diet, enjoy it as a healthy snack with fruit, or mix with garlic and fresh herbs as salad dressing. <br>Find out more about the benefits of dairy at <a href=""http://www.rediscoverdairy.co.za""><strong>rediscoverdairy.co.za</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

<figure><iframe title=""Amasi whole chicken"" src=""https://iframely.shorthand.com/T8XQWha""></iframe></figure>

<figure data-lazyload-container=""true"" data-lazyload-trigger=""true""><img alt="""" src=""""></figure>

<p>Adding amasi to a chicken renders it soft and tender, and adds that creamy, almost tangy taste to your dish. Amasi is a traditional ingredient that used to be made overnight in clay pots, and today it is still used for its unique flavour and goodness.</p>

<p>1 whole chicken</p>

<p>500ml amasi</p>

<p>salt and pepper</p>

<p>garlic</p>

<p>BBQ spice</p>

<p><strong>METHOD</strong></p>

<p>1. Mix all the ingredients for the amasi marinade in a very large ziplock bag, insert the chicken, and ensure the chicken is properly covered. <br>2. Marinade overnight by placing the ziplock with chicken and other ingredients in the fridge. <br>3. Grill over medium heat for 20 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through.</p>

<figure data-lazyload-container=""true"" data-lazyload-trigger=""true""><img alt="""" src=""""></figure>

<p><strong>One glass of amasi contains 50% of your daily vitamin B12 requirement, 30% of your daily calcium requirement and 20% of your daily potassium requirement.</strong> It also gives you vitamin A and good-quality protein. Make it part of your daily diet by enjoying it as an anytime drink, pouring it over your pap, using it as a substitute for buttermilk or yoghurt when baking, or adding it to soups, pasta, smoothies, dips and sauces. It’s also an excellent recovery drink after exercise. <br>Find out more at <a href=""http://www.rediscoverdairy.co.za""><strong>rediscoverdairy.co.za</strong></a>.</p>

"","Moving day is an exciting but often stressful experience. Whether you're relocating across town or to a new city, having a game plan in place can make all the difference.

To help make the day less stressful, RE/MAX of Southern Africa, shares their insights on how to make the process as smooth as possible…

DO remember to update your address with banks, insurance providers, and any subscriptions. If possible, make sure the internet is set up at your new home before you arrive.

DON’T forget to take measurements. Few things are more frustrating than realising your couch won’t fit through the front door after you’ve already lugged it up a steep driveway.

DO pack an essentials box / bag that includes toiletries, important documents, chargers, basic kitchen supplies, and a change of clothes. Keep that box with you for easy access to necessities when you arrive at the new home.

DON’T overload boxes. Keep boxes at a manageable weight to avoid injuries and prevent them from breaking. A well-packed, balanced load makes moving much safer and more efficient.

DO a final walkthrough. Before leaving your old home, check every room, closet, and drawer to ensure nothing is left behind. This also allows you one final moment to say goodbye to your old home.

DON’T leave packing until the last minute. Rushing to pack on moving day leads to disorganization and potential damage to your belongings. Give yourself enough time to sort, declutter, and properly pack your items.

DO leverage your relationship with your real estate professional. A good real estate agent does more than just find you a home; they can often connect you with trusted moving services, storage solutions, and even handyman services to assist with settling in.

Moving doesn’t have to be chaotic. By planning ahead, staying organised, and leveraging the expertise of a real estate professional, you can transition into your new home with ease. “A well-managed move sets the tone for a positive start in your new space,” concludes Adrian Goslett, Regional Director and CEO of RE/MAX of Southern Africa.

Make a List

Write everything down; you will thank yourself later. Before you pack even one box, create a simple record-keeping system. Create a numbered list that specifically names the contents in each numbered box. You can designate a spiral-bound notebook for the job or generate the list on a computer. Make sure you put a number on every box you pack. When describing the box contents, be specific—""A-D files"" is better than ""files"" and ""tulip dishes"" rather than ""kitchen."" Never put the list down unless it's in your ""packing central"" location. This is where you store your labels, marking pens, box tape, and other packing supplies. In the midst of activity, you will be able to find what you need.

Have Plenty of Supplies

You will need lots of boxes—​probably more boxes than you think and having enough boxes will make your life easier. If you buy your boxes from a moving company, you can always return unused boxes for a refund. Leave about 10 boxes set aside to use for last-minute items on moving day, such as bedding, clothing, and cleaning supplies.

You will need strong plastic packing tape to close up the boxes securely. Use unprinted newsprint paper (newspaper ink can stain some items), packing paper, or bubble wrap to wrap and cushion household goods. You will need a lot more supplies than you think, so get extra. Return any unused supplies after the truck is packed.

Colour Coordinate

Designate a colour for each room in the new home, such as yellow for the kitchen, orange for the dining room, and so on. Apply coloured stickers on the box near the box number. In your new home, put a matching sticker on the door to each room. The movers will know where to put everything when they arrive at the destination. It's also helpful to post a big sign on the wall in the room where you want boxes stacked, such as ""Boxes here please"" to keep them out of furniture and traffic areas.

Keep Things Together

Insist on keeping things together when you or the movers are packing boxes. Keep bookends with books, light bulbs with lamps, and extension cords with appliances. Small, loose parts can be attached to the item they belong to with tape or placed in small envelopes. Keep picture hooks with pictures, shelf brackets with the bookcase, and a special wrench and bolts with the wall unit. Keep larger corresponding items (such as a cable TV cord) in resealable bags, and tape these to the underside or back of the item.

As a backup, have a ""Parts Box"" open on the kitchen counter and fill it with cables, cords, parts, pieces, brackets, or nails that are removed from any items of furniture. Keep this box with you, or mark it well with a rainbow of colored stickers so it can be easily located on move-in day.

Pack Ahead and Use Your Containers

Anything you can pack ahead will save you time on moving day. If it's summer, get your winter clothes out of the way. You do not need multiple TVs around your house for the last few days there. Box up your shampoo and extra toothpaste and use items out of a travel cosmetic case for the last week or two. Pare down cooking utensils and food supplies to the bare essentials.

Wastebaskets can also be packed (put things in them) while you switch to using plastic grocery bags for trash collection.

Consolidate Cleaning Supplies

If you must clean your old place after moving out, put together a kit of basic cleaning supplies and rags. Clean ahead of moving day, such as the inside of kitchen cupboards, the oven, windows. Leave the vacuuming for moving day—vacuum each room as the movers empty it.

Safeguard Valued Items

It's a good idea to keep valuable possessions, such as silverware, collections, or antiques, with you. If you have a long move and no room in your car, bury the items in an intentionally mislabeled box ""Misc. kitchen pantry.""

Check your homeowner's insurance to see how you are covered during the move, and if you need additional insurance from the mover. Also, find out what paperwork (receipts, appraisals, and photos) you might need to file a claim in case of loss.

Keep important papers with you: birth certificates, school records, mover estimates, new job contacts, utility company numbers, recent bank records, current bills, phone lists, closing papers, realtor info, maps, and more. Don't leave these with the mover. Keep them with you.

Personal Boxes

Use brightly coloured storage boxes—one for each person. Let each family member fill theirs with items that they want right away in the new home—a set of sheets, a towel, a couple of extension cords, a phone, nightlights, pens and paper, keys, tissues, and travel cosmetic case, and so on.","<article>

<p><strong>DON’T </strong>overload boxes. Keep boxes at a manageable weight to avoid injuries and prevent them from breaking. A well-packed, balanced load makes moving much safer and more efficient.</p>

<p><strong>DO </strong>a final walkthrough. Before leaving your old home, check every room, closet, and drawer to ensure nothing is left behind. This also allows you one final moment to say goodbye to your old home.</p>

<p><strong>DON’T</strong> leave packing until the last minute. Rushing to pack on moving day leads to disorganization and potential damage to your belongings. Give yourself enough time to sort, declutter, and properly pack your items.</p>

<p><strong>DO </strong>leverage your relationship with your real estate professional. A good real <a href=""https://www.property24.com/estate-agents/search"" title=""Find an Estate Agent on Property24, South Africa’s leading Property Website"">estate agent</a> does more than just find you a home; they can often connect you with trusted moving services, storage solutions, and even handyman services to assist with settling in.</p>

<p>Moving doesn’t have to be chaotic. By planning ahead, staying organised, and leveraging the expertise of a real estate professional, you can transition into your new home with ease. “A well-managed move sets the tone for a positive start in your new space,” concludes Adrian Goslett, Regional Director and CEO of <a href=""https://www.property24.com/estate-agents/re-max-of-south-africa/g22"">RE/MAX of Southern Africa</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Make a List</strong></p>

<p>Write everything down; you will thank yourself later. Before you pack even one box, create a simple record-keeping system. Create a numbered list that specifically names the contents in each numbered box. You can designate a spiral-bound notebook for the job or generate the list on a computer. Make sure you put a number on <em>every</em> box you pack. When describing the box contents, be specific—""A-D files"" is better than ""files"" and ""tulip dishes"" rather than ""kitchen."" Never put the list down unless it's in your ""packing central<em>""</em> location. This is where you store your labels, marking pens, box tape, and other packing supplies. In the midst of activity, you will be able to find what you need.</p>

<p><strong>Have Plenty of Supplies</strong></p>

<p>You will need lots of boxes—​probably more boxes than you think and having enough boxes will make your life easier. If you buy your boxes from a moving company, you can always return unused boxes for a refund. Leave about 10 boxes set aside to use for last-minute items on moving day, such as bedding, clothing, and cleaning supplies.</p>

<p>You will need strong plastic packing tape to close up the boxes securely. Use unprinted newsprint paper (newspaper ink can stain some items), packing paper, or bubble wrap to wrap and cushion household goods. You will need a lot more supplies than you think, so get extra. Return any unused supplies after the truck is packed.</p>

<p><strong>Colour Coordinate</strong></p>

<p>Designate a colour for each room in the new home, such as yellow for the kitchen, orange for the dining room, and so on. Apply coloured stickers on the box near the box number. In your new home, put a matching sticker on the door to each room. The movers will know where to put everything when they arrive at the destination. It's also helpful to post a big sign on the wall in the room where you want boxes stacked, such as ""Boxes here please"" to keep them out of furniture and traffic areas.</p>

<p><strong>Keep Things Together</strong></p>

<p>Insist on keeping things together when you or the movers are packing boxes. Keep bookends with books, light bulbs with lamps, and extension cords with appliances. Small, loose parts can be attached to the item they belong to with tape or placed in small envelopes. Keep picture hooks with pictures, shelf brackets with the bookcase, and a special wrench and bolts with the wall unit. Keep larger corresponding items (such as a cable TV cord) in resealable bags, and tape these to the underside or back of the item.</p>

<p>As a backup, have a ""Parts Box"" open on the kitchen counter and fill it with cables, cords, parts, pieces, brackets, or nails that are removed from any items of furniture. Keep this box with you, or mark it well with a rainbow of colored stickers so it can be easily located on move-in day.</p>

<p><strong>Pack Ahead and Use Your Containers</strong></p>

<p>Anything you can pack ahead will save you time on moving day. If it's summer, get your winter clothes out of the way. You do not need multiple TVs around your house for the last few days there. Box up your shampoo and extra toothpaste and use items out of a travel cosmetic case for the last week or two. Pare down cooking utensils and food supplies to the bare essentials.</p>

<p>Wastebaskets can also be packed (put things in them) while you switch to using plastic grocery bags for trash collection.</p>

<p><strong>Consolidate Cleaning Supplies</strong></p>

<p>If you must clean your old place after moving out, put together a kit of basic cleaning supplies and rags. Clean ahead of moving day, such as the inside of kitchen cupboards, the oven, windows. Leave the vacuuming for moving day—vacuum each room as the movers empty it.</p>

<p><strong>Safeguard Valued Items</strong></p>

<p>It's a good idea to keep valuable possessions, such as silverware, collections, or antiques, with you. If you have a long move and no room in your car, bury the items in an intentionally mislabeled box ""Misc. kitchen pantry.""</p>

<p>Check your homeowner's insurance to see how you are covered during the move, and if you need additional insurance from the mover. Also, find out what paperwork (receipts, appraisals, and photos) you might need to file a claim in case of loss.</p>

<p>Keep important papers with you: birth certificates, school records, mover estimates, new job contacts, utility company numbers, recent bank records, current bills, phone lists, closing papers, realtor info, maps, and more. Don't leave these with the mover. Keep them with you.</p>

<p><strong>Personal Boxes</strong></p>

<p>Use brightly coloured storage boxes—one for each person. Let each family member fill theirs with items that they want right away in the new home—a set of sheets, a towel, a couple of extension cords, a phone, nightlights, pens and paper, keys, tissues, and travel cosmetic case, and so on.</p>

"","Receiving an offer well below your asking price can be frustrating for any home seller but it is important to remember that negotiating is all part of the process. With the right approach—and the guidance of an experienced real estate agent—you can turn a lowball offer into a successful sale.

“A low offer does not have to be a dealbreaker,” says Adrian Goslett, Regional Director and CEO of RE/MAX of Southern Africa. “Buyers may simply be testing the waters, so it’s important to remain open to negotiation rather than rejecting an offer outright.”

Lowball offers—those significantly below market value—are common, “especially in a buyer’s market like we are currently in across many most markets in SA,” Goslett notes. While these offers can feel discouraging, sellers should avoid taking them personally. Instead, he encourages sellers to consider why the buyer may be offering less. “It could be due to a perception of market conditions, the property’s condition, or simply a negotiating tactic,” he states.

“A professional agent knows how to gauge the seriousness of a buyer and can negotiate on your behalf to secure a better offer. They understand market trends, can justify your asking price with data, and ultimately ensure you get the best possible deal,” explains Goslett.

When presented with a lowball offer, RE/MAX of Southern Africa shares the following tips for how best to proceed next:

Stay Calm and Assess – Consider the offer objectively. Ask your agent how the offer compares to local market conditions, recent sales, and your home’s value before responding.
Counteroffer Strategically – Rather than outright rejecting the offer, work with your agent to present a reasonable counteroffer.
Know When to Walk Away – If an offer is unreasonably low and the buyer is unwilling to budge, or if the market is hot and another offer is sure to come your way soon, your agent can guide you on whether it’s best to move on and wait for a better opportunity.

“Negotiation is a process. Sometimes, a low offer is just the starting point for a fair deal. An agent can help bridge the gap between buyer and seller expectations and can let you know when it’s best to move on. If you want to sell your home for the best possible price, partnering with an experienced real estate professional truly is your best move,” says Goslett.

According to the Seeff Property Group, (The role of a real estate agent : What you need to know) agents do not only sell or rent property on behalf of their clients, but also have their ear to the ground in terms of what current property values are, how much properties might sell for, and what is happening in the property market.

Always meet the agents in person before appointing them:

This will give you a chance to ask questions and assess the agents. Check how long they have operated in the area. Each area is different and local expertise is a vital point of advantage for any seller.

Look for a successful sales track record:

Ask for a list of their recent sales in the area, how long it took to sell, and the prices achieved. A strong sales record is an important indicator of the likelihood of success and that the agent could find the right buyer for the property.

A strong brand and network is another advantage:

An established brand will have a strong online presence for maximum exposure of your property backed by the latest technology and marketing and sales methodologies. They will use best practice to market and sell your property.

Look for someone who will assist every step of the way:

Selling a property is a complex process with many legalities to be taken care of. A good agent will explain the process and guide the seller to ensure they have all the necessary documents and maintenance done for an efficient selling process.

Get the price right

Setting yourself up for selling success has a great deal to do with finding the pricing sweet spot. “Ultimately, prevailing market conditions determine what a property sells at. Of course that is influenced by the state of the property, the location and various other factors,” Viljoen says.

He adds that pricing it too low(in relation to similar properties in the area) tends to make buyers think there is something wrong with the property, while overpricing simply means that it won’t draw buyers. “Remember, buyers have access to various online tools and portals so they know exactly what similar properties are priced at,” Viljoen explains.

A property professional (see above!) is a great resource in this regard, and can work with a seller to establish the best, most accurate asking price for a property.

Understand the cost of selling

If there’s one thing to take from Viljoen’s advice it is to make very sure that, as the seller, you understand the various costs associated with selling a property. From bond cancellation costs to compliance certificates and agent commission, just because you’re the seller doesn’t mean you won’t incur costs.

Put your best foot forward

Lastly but as importantly, make sure that when a potential buyer views your property, they see it in the best light.

Put some effort into staging your home but ensuring it is clean, light and clutter-free at the very least. “The old adage about not getting a second chance to make a first impression is particularly true when it comes to potential buyers viewing properties,” Viljoen concludes.","<article>

<p>Receiving an offer well below your asking price can be frustrating for any home seller but it is important to remember that negotiating is all part of the process. With the right approach—and the guidance of an experienced real estate agent—you can turn a lowball offer into a successful sale.</p>

<p>“A low offer does not have to be a dealbreaker,” says Adrian Goslett, Regional Director and CEO of <a href=""https://www.property24.com/estate-agents/re-max-of-south-africa/g22"">RE/MAX of Southern Africa</a>. “Buyers may simply be testing the waters, so it’s important to remain open to negotiation rather than rejecting an offer outright.”</p>

<p>Lowball offers—those significantly below market value—are common, “especially in a buyer’s market like we are currently in across many most markets in SA,” Goslett notes. While these offers can feel discouraging, sellers should avoid taking them personally. Instead, he encourages sellers to consider why the buyer may be offering less. “It could be due to a perception of market conditions, the property’s condition, or simply a negotiating tactic,” he states.</p>

<p>“A professional agent knows how to gauge the seriousness of a buyer and can negotiate on your behalf to secure a better offer. They understand market trends, can justify your asking price with data, and ultimately ensure you get the best possible deal,” explains Goslett.</p>

<p>When presented with a lowball offer, RE/MAX of Southern Africa shares the following tips for how best to proceed next:</p>

<ol><li><strong>Stay Calm and Assess</strong> – Consider the offer objectively. Ask your agent how the offer compares to local market conditions, recent sales, and your home’s value before responding.</li>
<li><strong>Counteroffer Strategically</strong> – Rather than outright rejecting the offer, work with your agent to present a reasonable counteroffer.</li>
<li><strong>Know When to Walk Away</strong> – If an offer is unreasonably low and the buyer is unwilling to budge, or if the market is hot and another offer is sure to come your way soon, your agent can guide you on whether it’s best to move on and wait for a better opportunity.</li></ol>

"","Julian Jones, Caellyn Eedes and Liso Potwana examine a recent case that saw the Johannesburg High Court address abusive business rescue applications.

For more financial news, go to the News24 Business front page.

Ulterior motives disguised as good faith business rescue proceedings have become a growing concern in South African insolvency law. The introduction of the Companies Act, 2008 was a significant shift, promoting business rescue as a preferred alternative to liquidation.

However, courts have increasingly encountered cases where business rescue applications are used as a delay tactic, raising concerns about abuse.

This article examines the key legal principles and implications from the recent reportable judgment in Globustarr Trading Co L.L.C. v Mayana Properties (Pty) Ltd (case no. 2021-59389) handed down on 18 March 2025. The Johannesburg High Court addressed abusive business rescue applications used to obstruct liquidation and clarified the interpretation of ""liquidation proceedings"" under section 131(6) of the 2008 Act.

Background to the case

In December 2021, the applicant creditor sought a final winding-up order against the respondent under section 346 of the Companies Act 1973 (1973 Act), as the respondent was insolvent and unable to pay its debts.

However, multiple delays stalled the liquidation hearing. The court criticised one such delay – the respondent's exceptionally late filing of its answering affidavit – as a ""cynically designed to delay"" adjudication.

Just days before the liquidation hearing, the respondent filed an interlocutory adjournment application, attaching a separate business rescue application. It argued that this should suspend liquidation proceedings under either:

Section 347 of the 1973 Act, or

Section 131(6) of the 2008 Act.

The court considered two key statutory provisions

Section 347(1) of the 1973 Act provides that:

The court may grant or dismiss any application under section 346, or adjourn the hearing thereof, conditionally or unconditionally, or make any interim order or any other order it may deem just…

Section 131(6) of the 2008 Act states:

If liquidation proceedings have already been commenced by or against the company at the time an application is made in terms of subsection (1), the application will suspend those liquidation proceedings until: (a) the court has adjudicated upon the application; or (b) the business rescue proceedings end, if the court makes the order applied for.

The court had to determine whether the business rescue application was an abuse of process and, if so, whether the liquidation proceedings could continue despite section 131(6) of the 2008 Act.

Business rescue as an abuse of process

The court relied on the recent Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) judgement in PFC Properties (Pty) Ltd v Commissioner, South African Revenue Service and Others 2024 (1) SA 400 (SCA) (PFC Properties).

In this case, the SCA held that if a party uses the business rescue process for an ulterior purpose, such as to thwart winding-up proceedings, this undermines the rule of law, and so a court has the authority to non-suit that party. The SCA further clarified:

[T]he business rescue application was not 'made', as envisaged in section 131(6); the moratorium did not come into operation and did not suspend the winding-up proceedings. That being so, there was no impediment to the winding-up proceedings.

The High Court, after examining the substance (or lack thereof) of the business rescue application, and the respondent’s previous conduct, held that:

(a) there is no defence to the liquidation application; (b) the business rescue application was brought cynically at such a time so as to have the maximum disruptive effect on the adjudication of the liquidation application; and (c) there is no merit in the business rescue application. The business rescue application is therefore an abuse, brought in the face of a sound liquidation application.

Having found that the business rescue application was an abuse, the court confirmed that section 131(6) did not apply and dismissed the adjournment application.

The interpretation of liquidation proceedings in section 131(6)

The court also clarified long-standing ambiguity regarding the meaning of 'liquidation proceedings' in section 131(6) of the 2008 Act. By referencing the PFC Properties, the court confirmed that 'liquidation proceedings' include both the post-order winding-up process and the liquidation application itself.

The court reasoned that when a business rescue application is found to be an abuse of process, it is deemed not to have been ""made"" under section 131(6). As a result, the liquidation application remains unaffected and may proceed. The court specifically held that:

If section 131(6) did not apply to a liquidation application, then the question as to whether an abusive application for business rescue suspends a liquidation application does not arise. In my view, PFC Properties is therefore binding authority for the proposition that 'liquidation proceedings' in section 131(6) includes an application for liquidation.

This clarification is significant because it confirms that a bona fide business rescue application suspends a pending liquidation application under section 131(6). Litigants and courts must now carefully assess whether a business rescue application is being used for an ulterior purpose to delay a bona fide liquidation application.

The judgment sends a clear message to litigants seeking to misuse business rescue applications as a delay tactic. It reinforces the principle that courts will scrutinise the intent behind the business rescue applications and reject those brought in bad faith.

To deter future abuse, the court ordered de bonis propriis costs against the applicant in the business rescue application, meaning that the individual responsible for the application, not just the company, was personally liable for legal costs.

The Globustarr case judgment strengthens the integrity of business rescue proceedings while ensuring they are not exploited to stall liquidation. It clarifies the interpretation of section 131(6) and confirms that courts have the power to reject abusive business rescue applications.

For businesses, creditors, and legal practitioners, this ruling sets a clear precedent and reinforces the court’s role in safeguarding South Africa’s insolvency framework.

"","Last month, the National Planning Commission (NPC) convened a national dialogue on the state of service delivery in the country. This is an edited and abridged version of the remarks made by Professor Tinyiko Maluleke, deputy chair of the NPC, at the conference.

I am an unmitigated sucker for poetry and a hopeless addict of such stunning book opening lines such as those of Sol Plaatje's Native Life in South Africa and Es'kia Mphahlele's Down Second Avenue.

In a line or two, they captured the essence of the national tragedy of their times. Service delivery is becoming a crisis of our times.

How I wish I had such powers of diction to capture the impact and the meaning of the service delivery problems in our country at this time. How I wish I had the turn of phrase with which to encourage my fellow South Africans to ""rage, rage against the dying of the light"" of service delivery a la Dylan Thomas.

During his recent pre-G20 reconnaissance visit to the Gauteng province, President Cyril Ramaphosa confirmed that the country is in the midst of a service delivery crisis.

Service delivery: The trouble with South Africa

In the city of Lagos in the early 1980s, Chinua Achebe noticed that everywhere he went, most conversations started with the phrase ""the trouble with Nigeria is…"". So, Achebe decided to write a book titled: The Trouble with Nigeria. Thus begins the book:

The trouble with Nigeria is simply and squarely a failure of leadership. … The Nigerian problem is the unwillingness or inability of its leaders to rise to the responsibility, to the challenge of personal example which is the hallmark of true leadership.

In relation to service delivery, South Africa may have reached a similar stage as was the Nigeria of the early 1980s. An Achebian take on the trouble with South Africa at this time, might read like this:

The trouble with South Africa is simply and squarely a failure of service delivery. There is nothing basically wrong with the South African character. There is nothing wrong with South African land or climate or water or air or anything else. The South African problem is the unwillingness or inability of its leaders to rise to the responsibility of service delivery, which is the hallmark of true leadership at this point in our history.

The most common phrase on the lips of South Africans at this time and, perhaps, over most of the past thirty years, is the phrase, ""service delivery"".

A boy called Service Delivery

Nothing illustrates the ubiquity of the phrase ""service delivery"" in South African life better than the story of a boy named Service Delivery.

In the short and nondescript street of Letsogo in Zone 8, Meadowlands, Soweto, where I grew up, there is a boy called Service Delivery Mthimkhulu. During the morning of Saturday 9 June 2012, Service Delivery was almost not born. The week ending 10 June 2012 was the culmination of a sustained period of erratic service delivery in Meadowlands – intermittent water supply, frequent electricity cuts, sporadic waste removal, and unresponsive police.

As his heavily pregnant mother was being rushed to hospital, tyre-burning and toyi-toying service-delivery protesters had blocked the main road. Only the use of detours and shortcuts between Meadowlands and Diepkloof prevented Service Delivery from being born en route to Baragwanath Hospital. In light of the service delivery incidents and accidents of the day and the times, it must have seemed evident to the Mthimkhulus, once the baby was delivered, that the only fitting name for the newborn was Service Delivery.

To this day, his parents believe that the trauma of being born during such a turbulent time may explain why Service Delivery suffers both from sporadic bouts of epilepsy and fits of violent behaviour. He is in danger of slipping into the NEET category of young people - not in education, employment or training.

A Deeply Felt Reality

Indeed, ""service delivery"" may not be that elegant a phrase. It is too blunt, too mundane, too basic a phrase, with nothing exotic, poetic, or philosophical about it. It describes a deeply felt reality, which has been the national rallying cry for the past 20 years. It is the most accessible shorthand for the expression of the hopes and the needs of South Africans. The problems and promises of the seven national elections held since democracy all revolved around service delivery. By the May 2024 elections, service delivery was still a potent phrase, but by then, more as a problem than a promise.

One of the most striking and repeated features of the second half of our 30-year democracy has been the phenomenon of ""service delivery protests"" – protests about the most basic services: jobs, houses, water and sanitation, electricity, roads, transport, and human dignity.

I am yet to see a service delivery protest because of the absence of wi-fi. And that is not to say Wi-Fi, Facebook and WhatsApp have not become ""human rights"" in the 21st century. It is because South African service delivery protests are about things more basic.

Armed with the National Development Plan (NDP) Vision 2030, the National Planning Commission (NPC) has been trying to understand the root causes of poor service delivery. Note has been taken of the capacity and the maintenance issues within metros, municipalities and provinces.

Similarly, note has been taken of the poor planning coordination and the incoherence between the local, provincial, and national spheres of government. The disjuncture between the promises of the NDP and our Bill of Rights is jarring. The NPC has been hard at work trying to understand the causes, effects, scale, impact of poor service delivery, as well as how to return the country to the course laid out by the NDP.

South Africans have what it takes to overcome the problems of service delivery. As a nation, we know where we ought to be going as far as service delivery is concerned. We have clear national objectives and targets. We know what needs to be done. However, we also need to understand why and how we have gone off course and why we have achieved less than what we set out to do in the first place.

Service Delivery is sick

The Meadowlands lad called Service Delivery Mthimkhulu is growing into adolescence now. Recently, when I checked on the 13-year-old, I discovered that Service Delivery is sick – sick in the soul and sick in the body.

This brings me to the Miriam Makeba song about a sick child. Once when faced with a sick child in the house, she and her friend Dudu went looking for a sangoma.

Sahamba noDudu (off we went with Dudu)

Sayofun’isangoma (searching for a Sangoma)

Safik’isangoma sathi umtwana u ya gula (the Sangoma arrived and said the child is ill)

UMtwana uyagula (the child is ill?)

UmMtwana uyagula (the child is ill!)

Uphethwe yini naa? (What illness is troubling the child?)

The sangoma merely repeated what Miriam and Dudu already knew, asking the same questions as Miriam and Dudu had asked but providing no further analysis or cogent answers. In desperation, but without shedding any light on the problem, the sangoma eventually found someone to blame. ""There is a witch in this house!"" (umthakathi usendlini!) shouted the sangoma.

The national dialogue on the state of service delivery intended to do more than merely regurgitate what is known. The dialogue intended to do more than find someone to blame. At the dialogue, the root causes were probed, and frameworks for lasting solutions were sought. I am glad to confirm that the dialogue achieved all these and more.

But alas! Service Delivery is sick in Soweto and elsewhere. We must probe beyond the symptoms. We dare not let Service Delivery down.

Service delivery is the single most important conversation in South Africa today, apart from Donald Trump.

<p>To this day, his parents believe that the trauma of being born during such a turbulent time may explain why Service Delivery suffers both from sporadic bouts of epilepsy and fits of violent behaviour. He is in danger of slipping into the NEET category of young people - not in education, employment or training.</p>

<p><strong>A Deeply Felt Reality</strong></p>

<p>Indeed, ""service delivery"" may not be that elegant a phrase. It is too blunt, too mundane, too basic a phrase, with nothing exotic, poetic, or philosophical about it. It describes a deeply felt reality, which has been the national rallying cry for the past 20 years. It is the most accessible shorthand for the expression of the hopes and the needs of South Africans. The problems and promises of the seven national elections held since democracy all revolved around service delivery. By the May 2024 elections, service delivery was still a potent phrase, but by then, more as a problem than a promise.</p>

<p>One of the most striking and repeated features of the second half of our 30-year democracy has been the phenomenon of ""service delivery protests"" – protests about the most basic services: jobs, houses, water and sanitation, electricity, roads, transport, and human dignity.</p>

<p><strong>READ | </strong><a href=""https://www.news24.com/fin24/economy/world-bank-and-sa-have-r55bn-plan-to-reverse-the-collapse-in-major-cities-20250327""><strong>World Bank and SA have R55bn plan to 'reverse the collapse' in major cities</strong></a></p>

<p>I am yet to see a service delivery protest because of the absence of wi-fi. And that is not to say Wi-Fi, Facebook and WhatsApp have not become ""human rights"" in the 21st century. It is because South African service delivery protests are about things more basic.</p>

<p>Armed with the National Development Plan (NDP) Vision 2030, the National Planning Commission (NPC) has been trying to understand the root causes of poor service delivery. Note has been taken of the capacity and the maintenance issues within metros, municipalities and provinces.</p>

<p>Similarly, note has been taken of the poor planning coordination and the incoherence between the local, provincial, and national spheres of government.  The disjuncture between the promises of the NDP and our Bill of Rights is jarring. The NPC has been hard at work trying to understand the causes, effects, scale, impact of poor service delivery, as well as how to return the country to the course laid out by the NDP.</p>

<p>South Africans have what it takes to overcome the problems of service delivery. As a nation, we know where we ought to be going as far as service delivery is concerned. We have clear national objectives and targets. We know what needs to be done. However, we also need to understand why and how we have gone off course and why we have achieved less than what we set out to do in the first place.</p>

<p><strong>Service Delivery is sick</strong></p>

<p>The Meadowlands lad called Service Delivery Mthimkhulu is growing into adolescence now. Recently, when I checked on the 13-year-old, I discovered that Service Delivery is sick – sick in the soul and sick in the body.</p>

<p>This brings me to the Miriam Makeba song about a sick child. Once when faced with a sick child in the house, she and her friend Dudu went looking for a sangoma.</p>

<p><em>Sahamba noDudu</em> (off we went with Dudu)</p>

<p><em>Sayofun’isangoma</em> (searching for a<em> Sangoma</em>)</p>

<p><em>Safik’isangoma</em> sathi umtwana u ya gula (the <em>Sangoma</em> arrived and said the child is ill)</p>

<p><em>UMtwana uyagula</em> (the child is ill?)</p>

<p><em>UmMtwana uyagula</em> (the child is ill!)</p>

<p><em>Uphethwe yini naa?</em> (What illness is troubling the child?)</p>

<p>The sangoma merely repeated what Miriam and Dudu already knew, asking the same questions as Miriam and Dudu had asked but providing no further analysis or cogent answers. In desperation, but without shedding any light on the problem, the sangoma eventually found someone to blame. ""There is a witch in this house!"" (<em>umthakathi</em> usendlini!) shouted the sangoma.</p>

<p>The national dialogue on the state of service delivery intended to do more than merely regurgitate what is known. The dialogue intended to do more than find someone to blame. At the dialogue, the root causes were probed, and frameworks for lasting solutions were sought. I am glad to confirm that the dialogue achieved all these and more.</p>

<p>But alas! Service Delivery is sick in Soweto and elsewhere. We must probe beyond the symptoms. We dare not let Service Delivery down.</p>

<p>Service delivery is the single most important conversation in South Africa today, apart from Donald Trump.</p>

"","Join Chrizelda Kekana and reality TV star Lasizwe for a continuation of a light-hearted, candid conversation about what it means to intentionally ""grow up"" and what that manifests as in part two of this entertaining Brand New Adult episode. With self-development at the forefront of the conversation, the pair speak about creating boundaries with friends and family about how they must treat you and being real enough with your own shortcomings to know that sometimes you are the problem.

As we step deeper and deeper into adulthood, a couple of things are becoming clearer for us. Thankfully.

One of them is the need to be intentional about one's personal growth.

Join in for a relatable, candid conversation below:

Things like your favourite hobbies, the spaces you are comfortable in and the people you want to surround yourself with are seemingly more stable as you grow older. However, we continue to live among other humans, and as we navigate life, each going through different phases, we have to find ways to relate that don't bring our lives into absolute chaos.

This means, at times, we must take our ""Ls"" and recognise when we are the problem. At times, saying, ""that's just how I am,"" is not going to cut it and we need to do better for ourselves and people who love us.

That is the conversation that takes place between Chrizelda and reality TV star Lasizwe in this episode of Brand New Adult.

In case you missed the first part of this entertaining conversation all about handling personal finances as a young adult, click on the link below:","<article>

<p>As we step deeper and deeper into adulthood, a couple of things are becoming clearer for us. Thankfully.</p>

<p>One of them is the need to be intentional about one's personal growth.</p>

<p>Join in for a relatable, candid conversation below:</p>

<p>Things like your favourite hobbies, the spaces you are comfortable in and the people you want to surround yourself with are seemingly more stable as you grow older. However, we continue to live among other humans, and as we navigate life, each going through different phases, we have to find ways to relate that don't bring our lives into absolute chaos.</p>

<p>This means, at times, we must take our ""Ls"" and recognise when we are the problem. At times, saying, ""that's just how I am,"" is not going to cut it and we need to do better for ourselves and people who love us.</p>

<p>That is the conversation that takes place between Chrizelda and reality TV star Lasizwe in this episode of Brand New Adult.</p>

"","An interesting collection of the work of renowned artist Hannalie Taute are on exhibit from Thursday, 27 February, at the Oliewenhuis Art Museum in Bloemfontein.

The exhibition Euphoria . . . in sy Gloria is Taute’s 21st solo exhibition.

The 19 multi-media works portray her re-stitching of historical narratives into a fantastical rebirth of the fairy-tale wedding mythology.

It promises to be a celebration of times to come and aims to provoke a feeling of euphoria.

“I work primarily with the captured image.

“Altered, reimagined and reinterpreted. Using mainly vintage photographs sourced from flea markets and even from my own family archives, which are used as is, or blown up to a larger scale,” explains Taute.

“These discarded remnants of the past are reworked with embroidered rubber inner-tube inlays, and their treatment of these remnants are at times ghoulish and macabre, imbuing the work with notions of identity in terms of culture, heritage and society.

“A re-stitching of historical narrative of sorts.

“The surrealism of conflicting customs and traditions sutured, like stitching up a wound or incision, reminiscent of an autopsy.

“I want to create unsettling work tinged by a bit of humour that questions notions of family, childhood, identity and memory,” the artist explains.

Taute uses embroidery, historically regularly practiced by women, and combines this with discarded rubber inner-tubes, mostly used in heavy vehicles – especially ones from tractors used by farmers today.

These elements are used to enhance old photographs – reproduced by new technology – to create a fresh narrative.

Taute creates her own imaginary fairy-tale kingdom by removing the faces and historical identities from these vintage photographs; as she replaces them with a variety of cultural masks stitched onto rubber with colourful embroidered flowers, a new fantasy emerges.

Something for a world clinging to the need to believe in euphoria.

Humour and seriousness are juxtaposed to create a make-believe world for everyone to enjoy and discuss.

Taute further amplifies the story the exhibition is telling by concocting a clever, quirky title for each artwork.

Taute’s works are included in various private collections around the world, as well as the academic collection of the University of South Africa (Unisa).

She currently resides and works in Riversdale, at the foot of what is known as the Sleeping Beauty Mountain Range in the Western Cape, the Hessequa region.

The exhibition will be opened today at 18:00 by Prof. Adelheid von Maltitz, a practicing artist, as well as an associate professor at the Fine Arts department at the University of the Free State (UFS).
A walkabout takes place on Friday at 11:00.","<article>

<p>An interesting collection of the work of renowned artist Hannalie Taute are on exhibit from Thursday, 27 February, at the Oliewenhuis Art Museum in Bloemfontein.</p>

<p>The exhibition Euphoria . . . in sy Gloria is Taute’s 21st solo exhibition.</p>

<p>The 19 multi-media works portray her re-stitching of historical narratives into a fantastical rebirth of the fairy-tale wedding mythology.</p>

<p>It promises to be a celebration of times to come and aims to provoke a feeling of euphoria.</p>

<p>“I work primarily with the captured image.</p>

<p>“Altered, reimagined and reinterpreted. Using mainly vintage photographs sourced from flea markets and even from my own family archives, which are used as is, or blown up to a larger scale,” explains Taute.</p>
